Abby Grind,4.3,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,1.5,4.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/abby-grind/,"The Abby Grind is a steep hike that gains about 320 meters in 2km and ends at a scenic viewpoint looking southwest across Abbotsford. While not as steep as theGrouse Grind, the Abby Grind is still a good workout and a popular hiking trail. The trail is part of the route to Taggart Peak, also known as the Glen Ryder Trail, however the Abby Grind ends at the first viewpoint about 2km up. Hikers wanting to continue to Taggart Peak can do so for an additional 3.5km one-way. From the gravel parking lot area, the trail begins to the right by the bushes, immediately climbing up the hill. With the start of the trail being located near the Abbotsford Fish & Game Club, you will likely hear gunshots from the target range at the beginning of the trail, however the trail veers east and eventually the sounds become unnoticeable. Continue hiking uphill as the narrow trail becomes slightly wider and easier to follow after the initial section. Not far into the hike, you reach a sign on a tree marking the 1/4 mark of the hike. The section just after this point levels out as you quickly make time. As the trail again climbs, you reach the 1/2 way point along one of the steepest sections of the route. This is a difficult spot to stop to rest, so continue up the steep section until the trail levels where there is more space to catch your breath. Further up the trail at the 3/4 marker, the trail split into two different routes. Going right is shorter but steeper and going left is a bit longer but not quite as steep. The recommendation is to go right up the steeper, shorter route, then return via the less-steep route as it's easier to hike down. As you hike up the steeper route, watch for the trail to the left that you'll want to return on as it is not marked and appears at a corner to the left as the trail goes right. Eventually, you reach a marked junction where the trail goes to Taggart Peak to the left and the viewpoint to the right. Go right to the viewpoint and walk the short distance to an opening on a rocky bluff, marking the end of the Abby Grind. After enjoying the view of the Abbotsford area, walk back into the forest and begin your descent back to the parking lot. Just after passing the junction that goes to Taggart Peak, the trail veers left. Instead of going left, go straight and follow the alternate trail that is less steep and joins the main trail at the 3/4 mark. Being less steep, this route will be easier on your knees. At the 3/4 marker, continue following the route downhill as you move quickly through the gradually descending sections. Watch your footing on the loose dirt on the steep sections. Eventually, as you hear the gunfire from the shooting range, the parking lot becomes visible between the trees and you arrive back at where you began."
Admiralty Point,4.5,Tri Cities,Easy,1.5,5.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/admiralty-point/,"Located in Belcarra Regional Park, Admiralty Point is a short hike that offers spectacular views of Deep Cove, Mount Seymour, and Burnaby Mountain across the waterways connecting Burrard Inlet with Indian Arm. The trail has very little elevation change and is perfect for families. From the parking lot facing the water, walk towards the public bathrooms and follow the paved path towards the beach area. Before reaching the beach, a small sign on your left points in the direction to Admiralty Point. Follow the dirt trail into the forest and away from the crowded park area. Shortly after walking on the dirt trail, you arrive at a gravel road which is actually a driveway for one of the houses in the area. Cross the driveway and follow the trail as it begins to ascend. The short hill begins to level out very quickly and then follows a short flat section before descending back downhill where the water becomes visible through the trees. The trail continues along the shoreline, offering glimpses of scenery and the passing boats on a warm summer's day. The trail eventually reaches a sign pointing the way to Cod Rock. This is a short side track with a view worth checking out before continuing along the trail. After walking another kilometer from Cod Rock, the trail reaches a junction with a sign pointing the direction to Admiralty point. Go right and follow the path about 100 meters to a rocky outcrop along the shore. You've reached your destination and this is a great spot to relax and enjoy the beautiful view of the North Shore mountains as the waves lap up against the rocks. After enjoying the scenery at Admiralty Point, return to the main trail where the sign to Admiralty Point was. The trail continues for another 30 minutes or so to a beach area and Burns Point. The beach offers a similar view to what Admiralty Point has and is only a short distance beyond the junction. Burns Point offers a view of the waterway connecting Burrard Inlet with Port Moody. When you are ready to return to the picnic and parking area at Belcarra Regional Park, re-trace your steps along the trail and follow the path along the shoreline. Another hike in Belcarra Regional Park is the trail toJug Island Beach. The trail to Jug Island Beach is a bit more difficult and both trails can be hiked in one day."
Al's Habrich Ridge Trail,4.2,Howe Sound,Intermediate,5.0,7.0,July - October,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/als-habrich-ridge-trail/,"Starting from the top of the Sea To Sky Gondola, the Al's Habrich Ridge Trail rises into the backcountry to offer incredible views of Howe Sound and the community of Squamish, BC. The route goes just beyond Neverland Lake and an extended route can be hiked to Neverland Falls. The Al's Habrich Ridge Trail is best done by taking the Sea To Sky gondola to the top but can also be done after hiking the Sea To Summit route from the bottom of the gondola. Walk to the area behind the Gondola and down the gravel road as you enter the backcountry. At the bottom, walk up the gravel road on the other side as it passes some water pumps and then a rock climbing area. At the first junction, go left following the signs up a separate gravel road. Continue past another clearing to your left  until you reach a sign on your left where the trail enters the forest to the Al's Habrich Route. The trail immediately crosses a small creek, which is sometimes dry in the later summer months. Continue following the trail markers as the route climbs quickly, passing over loose dirt. The trail will eventually reach a large rock with a rope hanging down to assist in pulling yourself to the top. Just beyond the rope assist is a second, smaller rope. Pull yourself to the top of both before continuing to make your way uphill. Just beyond the rope assists, the trail begins to open up and follow a ridge along a granite rocky outcrop. Watch for markers and follow the route as it's easy to lose the trail through this section. There are occasional views of the mountain ranges to the west of Howe Sound and the views get better the higher you climb. The trail eventually reaches the top of this rocky ridge before dropping down into an old growth forest of yellow cedars. Follow the dirt trail through the forest as it climbs fairly steeply, being careful not to trip over the occasional exposed tree root. The trail will eventually begin to descend between two large rocks before it opens up with an incredible view of Howe Sound. On a clear day, the view will extend through a good portion of Howe Sound and north of Squamish. For a better view, backtrack along the trail for about 20-meters then scramble up the mountain to your left onto the large rock. From the top, you will be able to see a similar view of Howe Sound and Squamish but also view the Chief and several of the mountains in Garibaldi Provincial Park. To continue the trail from where you first arrived at the view (if you scrambled to the top, carefully make your way back down), you will go left on the rocky granite and walk along the ridge admiring the view. There are the occasional blue arrows painted onto the rock pointing the direction to where you need to go. At the end of the ridge, the route steps off the back of the ridge and onto a dirt trail that enters the forest. Follow this trail as it meanders through the trees, first passing a junction to the trail that takes you to the high ridge, then passing a junction with a trail that takes you to Neverland Falls. Not far beyond the second junction, you reach Neverland Lake, a small lake that has a small waterfall on the far end up to the early summer. There are a couple of additional viewpoints beyond the lake that are within 10-minutes or so. To continue, walk to the far end of the lake, cross the rocks where the river drains, then walk up the rocky steps, following the trail at the top. The trail dips down into the trees before rising onto another rocky outcrop with a view of Howe Sound. Continue to the right, following the ridge as you make your way to the top a few minutes later. The views at the top include Howe Sound and northward towards Garibaldi. This area marks the end of the Al's Habrich Ridge Trail. Before returning, those who want to add another 1-hour longer to their trip can complete the Neverland Loop Trail, which begins at the first junction beyond the lake on your way back. Go right and follow the trail uphill through the old growth forest. This route passes the Neverland Falls, which is a scenic waterfall, which is best viewed earlier in the summer before the snowpack melts. Return to the Sea To Sky Gondola by following the forested trail back around, then walking along the ridge with the incredible view. Walk up into the forest as it then descends quickly before arriving at the lower granite ridge. Carefully watch for the trail markers as you walk along the ridge, make your way back down the rope-assists, and then return to the gravel road before reaching the gondola where you began."
Alaksen National Wildlife Area,0.0,Tsawwassen and Delta,Easy,2.0,7.5,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/alaksen-national-wildlife-area/,"Alaksen National Wildlife Area is only openMonday - Friday from 8am - 3pmandClosed on Statutory Holidays. The Alaksen National Wildlife Area is located on the Fraser River Delta, providing an important habitat for many bird species, including being a stopover for many migratory birds. The area is managed under the Canada Wildlife Act and is a great opportunity for bird watchers to experience many different species of birds throughout the year. Alaksen National Wildlife Area is only open Monday to Friday from 8am to 3pm and closed on Statutory Holidays. There are three trails in Alaksen National Wildlife Area: Triangle Loop Trail:A 1.7km trail roundtrip.Roberts Bank Trail:A 5.8km trail roundtrip that starts from a junction with the Triangle Loop Trail.Sunnyside Trail:A 2.2km trail This trail description recommends walking the Triangle Loop Trail, then continuing along the Fraser River on the Roberts Bank Trail to the end. From there, walk back to the junction with the Triangle Loop Trail and go right, returning to the parking lot area. We recommend skipping the Sunnyside Trail as most of it is covered with no views. From the gravel parking lot area, walk west along the road and go to the right, walking on a gravel road northward. As you approach the building, look for a sign to the right and follow the narrow gravel road along a dyke as it passes under a canopy of trees. The trail continues until it veers left at a point along the Fraser River. Walk along the trail, admiring the views of the Fraser River and the forest and marshland to the left. During the spring months, there is a constant chirping of dozens of different bird species, including red winged blackbirds, yellow warblers, marsh wrens, and song sparrows. The trail reaches a junction and this marks the start of the Roberts Bank Trail. Continue walking straight as it follows the wide, flat path alongside the Fraser River. The views peer across the Fraser River as you catch a glimpse of Steveston. The trail ends next to a marshy canal. If you're lucky, you may spot a great blue heron stalking its prey or a bald eagle flying overhead. Retrace your steps back along the gravel path as you observe the views from a different angle. When you reach the junction, go right and walk along the gravel path as you pass several buildings, returning back to the parking area where you began."
Aldergrove Regional Park,4.4,Surrey and Langley,Easy,2.0,5.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/aldergrove-regional-park/,"Aldergrove Regional Park is located on the border of Aldergrove and Langley and just a short distance from the US Border. The park is very popular with families for its easy trails, scenic landscape, and multiple picnic areas. The area also has a number of horse trails and the wide open section of Aldergrove Bowl is popular with horseback riders. The ""historic"" lake in the park was formerly located on the west side but had to be removed due to needing major repairs. The lake was actually a man-made cement pool but was filled in and is now a grassy picnic area. There are several routes in the park, however we focus on the hiking trails and try to avoid the multi-use trails. Park the car near the picnic area and start your hike at the east end of the park lot, looking for the Pepin Brook Trail sign. Follow the trail as it winds its way along the slow moving waterway and through the forest, passing a couple of junctions that go to the Rock N' Horse Trail to your right. At the third junction, you will have to decide whether to do a longer hike to the Aldergrove Bowl or loop back doing a shorter circuit to the picnic area. To go to Aldergrove Bowl, go right and continue along the the same side of Pepin Brook, eventually arriving at Lefeuvre Road. Go right and walk along the road for about 250 meters where you will see a parking lot on your right. Walk into the parking lot for a view of the bowl and take one of the trails that loops around the area. The viewpoint on top of one of the area's rolling hills is worth checking out as it offers a pretty view of the area. Once you have completed the Aldergrove Bowl area, return via the route you came or you can also find your way back to the Pepin Brook Trail via the Rock N' Horse Trail. Back at the third junction, if you have decided to just do the shorter loop, go left and cross the wooden bridge over Pepin Brook. The gravel trail continues to another junction, where going right takes you to a large dog off-leash area. Go left and continue along the trail as it begins to ascend, crossing a couple of creeks that feed into the stream below. As the trail levels, it exists the forest and you arrive at a junction near the upper parking area of the main entrance. Go left and over the tiny hill and follow the trail as it descends quickly downhill arriving at the main parking lot below. Once back at the parking lot, there are some small trails to explore that circle the ""historic"" lake and the field near the picnic area. You can decide whether to walk around these or continue walking through the parking lot, back to the car."
Alexandra Bridge,4.8,Fraser Valley East,Easy,0.5,1.6,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/alexandra-bridge/,"Located along the mighty Fraser River, Alexandra Bridge served as an important link connecting the Cariboo region to Fort Langley. Today, the old Alexandra Bridge (the 2nd one built) provides a place for visitors to the area to stop and see an important piece of history in the area while also enjoying the incredible views of the Fraser Canyon. The trail is a short hike downhill to the bridge from the picnic area in the Provincial Park. From the sign at the start of the trail near the parking lot, follow the path into the forest as it descends and, within a couple of minutes, arrives at an old road. This was the old road that was used to access the bridge. Go left and follow the old road downhill. The road goes through a switchback and then crosses some train tracks. Be cautious at the tracks as they are very active with plenty of daily freight trains passing through the valley each day. Continue following the trail as it goes down, rounds through a switchback to the right, then one final straight away to the bridge. Walk out onto the old bridge with it's metal grates that provide a view of the fast rushing Fraser River below. As you walk across the bridge and look down stream, you can see the bridge that is in use along the Trans Canada Highway today. On the far side of the bridge, some of the cement structures stand and there is an opportunity to see the thick cables that hold the structure in place. Return to the parking lot by following the old road back uphill, crossing the train tracks, then walking back up the trail to the right. The Nlaka'pamux and Sto:lo First Nations have lived for thousands of years along the Fraser Canyon. There is evidence that an early bridge was built by local First Nations as a way to access important fishing areas along the Fraser. There were plans in the 1840's to connect New Caledonia with Fort Langley. New Caledonia refers to the central and northern section of current day British Columbia before BC became a Province in 1871. The area was a district of the Hudson's Bay Company, used for fur trading, and the original need was to build a trail connecting this region to Fort Langley, which was an important trading and shipping hub at the time. In 1858, a ferry service was established that connected the east and west shores to be used throughout the Gold Rush era. With more people flocking to the area during this period, it was a clear that a bridge was needed. Led by Joseph Trutch, the first road bridge was constructed in 1861 and was part of the Cariboo Wagon Road that stretched from Yale to Barkerville. The construction of the road through the Fraser Canyon was a difficult task and, at the time, a major engineering feat. Much of the difficult and dangerous work along the route was done by First Nations and Chinese workers, many who lost their lives. The bridge was named after Princess Alexandra of Wales. The Fraser Flood of 1894 destroy the original bridge and the structure was never rebuilt. In the 1880's, the Canadian Pacific Railway was built through the treacherous sections of the Fraser Canyons and several sections of the Cariboo Wagon Road were used for the tracks. In the 1920's, the rise of the automobile saw the Province of British Columbia invest in the construction of the new Cariboo Highway through the Fraser Canyon. The second Alexandra Bridge was built across the river, enabling vehicle traffic to pass through the area. The suspension bridge is still the same one that exists today today, although it was closed to traffic in 1964 after the Ministry of Transportation built the third Alexandra Bridge. Alexandra Bridge Provincial Park was established in 1984 to provide access to the second bridge. The park provides a timely location for a rest along the driving route through the Fraser Canyon and the trail is just 500-metres in each direction. The bridge provides some magnificent views of the rugged canyon below as well as the steep cliffs that makeup the area."
Alice Lake,4.1,Howe Sound,Easy,2.0,6.0,April - November,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/alice-lake/,"A popular camping spot in the summer, Alice Lake contains a network of hiking trails perfect for those looking to get outdoors for a nice walk. The Four Lakes Trail offers a scenic easy hike that loops around the park and passes lakes, creeks, and groves of Cedar, Hemlock, and Douglas Fir trees. From the parking lot, walk towards the beach area of Alice Lake and follow the path, heading counterclockwise around the lake.  On the opposite side of the lake is another small beach area and a parking lot. Walk up the steps to the parking lot and a short distance to the left is a trail that heads uphill next to a small creek. A sign should mark the start of this trail as the ""Four Lakes Trail"". Take the ""Four Lakes Trail"" as it heads uphill and away from the crowds. A couple of small bridges cross the creek before the trail becomes a bit steeper and goes through a series of switchbacks. After a few switchbacks, the trail levels out and continues for another 10 minutes to a sign that points to Edith Lake. Walk down the short hill and on the other side of the trees sits Edith Lake. Continue a short distance to the left for a better view. To head to the next lake, continue walking along the wide road to the left towards an intersection with another gravel road. Cross the intersection and continue straight as the road narrows. A short distance later, you will reach another junction with an old sign. Stay to the left and just a few steps further is another sign that leads to a short trail to Fawn Lake, the third lake of this loop. Fawn Lake is the smallest of the four lakes but is also very scenic and has a nice area to sit and have a snack while enjoying the scenery. Walk back to the main trail and immediately go left, taking the trail towards Stump Lake. The trail weaves through the forest and gradually descends downhill. Eventually, you reach another junction with a sign. Continue walking straight as the sound of rushing water from the Cheekye River becomes louder. The trail winds through another forest grove before reaching a switchback where the Cheekye River can be seen below. A short distance from the river, the trail comes up over a small ridge to reveal a view of Stump Lake. Go left at the junction and walk alongside the lake, keeping an eye out for other scenic views. At the far end of Stump Lake, you reach a final junction with a sign that takes you back towards the camping area and parking lot of Alice Lake. Take this trail to the paved road. Carefully cross the road and walk down the other side into the camping area until you reach the end of the road and can see Alice Lake. Go right and walk towards the parking lot where you started your hike."
Ancient Cedars Trail,3.3,Whistler,Intermediate,2.0,5.0,June - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ancient-cedars-trail/,"Located just north of Whistler, the Ancient Cedars Trail follows a scenic, forested route that ends in a grove of massive old-growth cedar trees. The trailhead begins 4.5km up the Cougar Mountain forest service road, a gravel road that is accessible in the summer and most cars should be drive. From the parking area, walk past the Ancient Cedars Trail sign and up the gravel path as it gently ascends for the first section before climbing steadily. The grade of the trail isn't too difficult but on a hot summer's day, it can be challenging. Continue uphill until the trail flattens and you pass a 1km marker on a tree. Pass through a flat section and follow the trail as it goes down a short hill and exits onto a wider, rocky trail. At this junction, go right and uphill, carefully watching your step on the loose rocks. At the top, go left and follow the trail back into the forest. The trail weaves its way through the forest before passing a large rock and reaching a junction just beyond. It's worth the short walk down this side trail for a quick view of Cougar Lake and the surrounding forest. Back on the trail, continue your hike until you reach a bridge. This is the start and end point of the loop as you will return from the trail on your right. Go straight across the bridge and, almost immediately after, look for a small waterfall from the creek to your left. Continue your hike through the forest and only a few minutes later, you arrive at the forest of several massive cedar trees. This small grove of trees was one of the few areas around Whistler not logged and some of these trails are estimated to be hundreds of years old. Continue through the grove, taking your time to enjoy the forest. Cross the small wooden bridge and down the trail, returning to the start of the loop next to the initial bridge. Go left and retrace your footsteps back through the forest, down the steep gravel trail, making sure to go left at the junction. Up the short hill and back into the forest before descending back downhill to the parking lot area where you began."
Ascent Trail,4.5,Whistler,Difficult,3.5,6.1,July - September,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ascent-trail/,"The Ascent Trail is a steep hiking trail that starts from the base of Blackcomb Mountain and ends at the top next to the Rendezvous Lodge. The trail is a good workout yet the route has been built in such a way that you sometimes forget that you are hiking next to ski slopes. The trail passes through scenic forested sections, crosses bridges over small creeks, and meanders up ski hills with incredible views of the Whistler area below. The trail is generally hiked from the bottom to the top and then you can take the chairlift back down. However, if you do not have a seaon's pass, you MUST purchase an Ascent Trail Download ticket from Guest Services before you hike up the mountain. Make sure that you check the operating schedule of the Solar Coaster Express and Wizard Chairlifts before hiking to the top as they close at different times throughout the season. There are three sections to the Ascent Trail: Some hikers choose to hike the first two sections to where the top of the Wizard Chairlift meets the bottom of the Solar Coaster Express Chairlift. At this point, you can take a chairlift back down or take a chairlift up to the top and not hike the third section. If you plan to take the chairlift up the third section, you will need to purchase a different ticket before you begin the hike. From the base of Blackcomb Mountain, the trailhead is located just up the hill, to the right of the Wizard Chairlift where a large wooden overhang stands at the entrance to the forest. Follow the trail as is gently climbs, crossing small bridges and weaving through the forest area. The trail exits the forest and then climbs a steep, gravel path before entering the forest again. Continue following the well market route until it, again, exits the forest and follows a gravel path up to a sign marking the start of Big Burn. Begin hiking up the second section of trail as you quickly gain elevation and realize why it's called Big Burn. Cross a gravel road and continue into the forest, following the trail. This section of forest is quite long and climbs up several steep sets of wooden stairs before, eventually, reaching another gravel road. Cross the gravel road and follow the worn trail up the ski run as it zig-zags back and forth. Make sure to stop and look back at the incredible view of the Whistler area behind you. During the mid-summer months, the wildflowers often grow on the ski runs, making for a very colourful display as you admire the views. The trail enters back into the forest and continues its steep ascent, making its way up several more sets of wooden stairs. Eventually, you exit the forest and arrive next to the Wizard and Solar Coaster Express chairlifts. At this point you have to decide whether you will be hiking the third section. The Heart Burn section is the longest and gains the most elevation, however it passes through a series of long switchbacks and has fewer stairs than the Big Burn section. Follow the trail as it climbs through the ski run, following the path towards the chairlift, before veering right. The trail enters the forest and immediately climbs up a large set of stairs before, again, veering right and then beginning a series of gradual switchbacks. Take advantage and enjoy the views when the trails briefly leaves the forest areas. As you continue to feel the burn on your legs, the trail pretty much has similar views, until you hike up a small ravine and arrive next to a kids castle with slides. This play area is only used in the winter though as the slides have a long drop where there would normally be snow. Continue hiking up the hill and walk through a small tunnel. The trail continues a bit further to another gravel road. Cross the gravel road and begin ascending the final forested section. This section of trail has some fairly steep sections however, occasional glimpses of the Peak 2 Peak Gondola can be seen through the trees, offering relief that the end is near. The trail reaches a point where it exits the forest and then follows signs up to the Rendezvous Lodge."
Baden Powell Deep Cove to Lynn Canyon,4.1,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.0,12.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/baden-powell-deep-cove-to-lynn-canyon/,"The eastern section of the Baden Powell trail travels through North Vancouver from Deep Cove to the Lynn Valley Suspension Bridge. This section of the trail passes several scenic landscapes, from a view of Deep Cove and Indian Arm, to great canyon scenery of the Seymour River and Lynn Creek. Note that this hike has a different starting and ending point, so you will need to arrange transportation either back to your car at the starting point or through public transit. A sign marks the Baden Powell trailhead in Deep Cove just beyond the small community along Panorama Road next to some houses. Walk up the wooden stairs to where the dirt trail begins and continue your ascent up the side of the mountain. The first section of the trail is known by the locals asQuarry Rock, a short hiking trail that takes you to a large rock with a view of the entire Deep Cove and Indian Arm area. Follow the trail as it weaves its way through the forest, gradually climbing, then levelling, crossing small wooden bridges along the route. As you arrive at Quarry Rock, walk out onto the large rocky outcrop and enjoy the scenic views of Deep Cove, Indian Arm, and Belcarra and Port Moody across the water. After taking in the view, make your way back to the trail and follow the trail up the rocky hill until you reach a gravel road. Stay to the right and then go right at what looks like a junction. Take the trail back into the forest on the left as it leaves the gravel road and continues to gradually snake its way uphill. Not long after leaving the gravel road, the trail reaches a paved road called Indian River Drive. The Baden Powell Trail continues west along this road, so go left and walk alongside the road, carefully watching for cars passing alongside the narrow road. The start of the Baden Powell trail is next to a large water tower on the opposite side of the road. Carefully cross the road and continue your hike. The next section of trail is relatively flat with some gradual ascents, making it easy to cover quite a distance in a relatively short period of time. The forest is lush, think with douglas fir and western cedar trees as you enter into the Mount Seymour area. The trail eventually reaches the Mount Seymour parkway, where there is an outhouse for those needing a quick bathroom break. The road can be busy at times and cars are often speeding as they round the corner coming downhill, so be very cautious when crossing the Mount Seymour parkway. Once on the other side, disappear again into the forest and continue your hike. Shortly after leaving the road, the trail reaches a 4-way intersection. Go straight and follow the rocky trail along a fairly level grade, once again, covering a fair amount of distance in a relatively short period of time, and eventually passing the west park boundary. The trail eventually reaches a junction with the Mushroom Trail. Go left on the Mushroom Trail and follow the Baden Powell markers, staying to the right and avoiding the popular mountain bike trail known as Severed Dick. For the next section, the trail descends quickly over very rocky terrain, making this a challenge to keep your balance and footing. Continue downhill for another 20 to 30 minutes before reaching another junction and go right, following the signs marking the Baden Powell trail. There are a series of trails near this neighbourhood so make sure to follow the well marked signs and watch for the orange Baden Powell markers on the trees. The trail eventually reaches a neighbourhood road, a popular car parking area with hikers and mountain bikers looking to explore the nearby trails. Directly across the road, the Baden Powell continues in a narrow section of trail between the houses, as it wraps its way through the neighbourhood. Go left at the next junction and walk a short distance to a clearing where a trail on the right veers off and down a very steep hill towards a pipe bridge crossing the Seymour River. Cross the bridge and immediately walk up the steep steps and hillside that snakes its way to the top. Once at the top, cross under the power lines and continue to the road up ahead. Cross the road and continue following the Baden Powell trail through the winding forest until you reach another junction. Go right at this junction and make your way downhill, descending towards Lynn Creek and a section of raised boardwalks. Just off to the left of the first set of boardwalks, there is a rocky beach area with a scenic view of Lynn Creek as it passes through a rocky canyon. Back on the trail, continue following the path alongside the creek as it gradually heads uphill until you reach the popular tourist waterfall at Twin Falls. After enjoying the view, it's only a short distance to the end of this sect of trail. Continue your hike as it reaches a set of wood steps and a slightly steeper section of the trail. Once you have climbed up the final series of steps, go left at the junction with the sign pointing the way to Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and walk over the wooden walkways before crossing the suspended bridge, now high above Lynn Creek. On the other side of the bridge is the Lynn Valley Ecology Centre marking the end of this section of the Baden Powell Trail."
Baden Powell Lynn Canyon to Grouse,3.9,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.0,10.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/baden-powell-lynn-canyon-to-grouse/,"The section of the Baden Powell from Lynn Canyon to Grouse Mountain crosses North Vancouver, passing through scenic forests, over numerous creeks, while closely hugging the steep mountain slopes. Note that this hike has a different starting and ending point, so you will need to arrange transportation either back to your car at the starting point or through public transit. The trail starts from a steep set of wooden stairs between the main and overflow parking area in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park. On the left side of the road, climb up the set of stairs, pacing yourself as you occasionally stop to catch your breath. At the top, the trail continues into the forest before steadily climbing again. The trail eventually reaches the Old Grouse Mountain Road which starts from the top of Mountain Highway. This route is still used to take large supplies up to Grouse Mountain and is also popular with mountain bikers accessing various trails in the region. Continue along the Baden Powell trail, crossing several bridges before reaching a wooden bench with a view of the city that is barely noticeable through the tree line. Not far from this point, you reach another view between the trees just above Prospect. Continue around the corner, passing the water towers, the junction with the Old Grouse Trail, and make your way down to the bridge crossing Mosquito Creek. On the other side of Mosquito Creek, go right and walk uphill as the trail bends to the left and passes just above a house before going right and becoming very steep. Once at the top of the steep section, the trail joins with an old road and parking area at the top of Skyline. Go right and follow the trail as it wraps around to the left and then continues towards the base of Grouse Mountain. Once again, the trail climbs through the forest alongside the mountain before making two crossings at East MacKay Creek. Continue along the trail to West MacKay Creek, at which point the trail becomes more level. After crossing over a small log, the trail begins to descend and this is a sign of the final section to Grouse. Cross a wooden bridge and carefully walk over the the tree roots before reaching the junction with the Grouse Grind trail. Continue straight for another couple hundred meters to the parking area at the base of Grouse Mountain."
BCMC Trail,3.9,The North Shore,Difficult,1.5,3.0,June - September,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/bcmc-trail/,"Updated April 25, 2025- The BCMC Trail is open from 7:00am to 6:30pm daily. The trail will be closed April 28th and April 30th for tree work. The BCMC Trail is located just east of theGrouse Grindand offers a less busy alternative workout. The start of the trail is the same place as the start of the Grind before branching off onto the Baden Powell, then left at the junction up the steep hill to the Grouse Mountain chalet. Note, most people take the Grouse Gondola back downhill as the steep, rocky slopes can be dangerous to descend. The Gondola costs $20 (as of 2021) and tickets can be purchased at the top in the chalet. The distance and time for this trail description are a one-way trip, different from other trails on the site, as it's assumed hikers will take the gondola back down. After walking past the fence at the beginning of the trail, there is a junction on the right to the Baden Powell Trail, just before the start of the hill. This junction is about 5 meters beyond the gate, so if you have started to walk up a steep, rocky hill, you have missed it. Go right at the junction and follow the Baden Powell trail as it gradually climbs through the forest. About 10 minutes into your hike, there is a junction on the left marking the way to the BCMC Trail. Looking for the tree markers as the area is well marked with unique markers for both the BCMC and Baden Powell Trails. Go left at the junction and begin your steep climb. As you climb, look at the markers on the trees and note the numbers, keeping in mind the end is marker number 160. The marker numbers are not evenly spaced but it does give somewhat of an indication of where you are on the trail. Around marker number 125, the trail begins to level off and there and climbs at a much more gradual pace. Eventually, you arrive at a junction with a wider path. Go left and continue up hill, being careful to step over the pipes and cables that are partially buried along the route. Only a few more steps and the Grouse Mountain chalet can be seen between the trees as you emerge from the forest and meeting with the crowds coming up the nearby Grouse Grind."
Beaumont Marine Park,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Intermediate,2.5,5.2,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/beaumont-marine-park/,"Beaumont Marine Park is located on south Pender Island along Bedwell Harbour and has beautiful sandy beaches and coastal views. The area is part of the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve managed by Parks Canada and access is either by boat or hiking into the areal. Camping is available near the beaches and reservations can be made with Parks Canada. The hike to Beaumont Marine Park is a popular day hike and can be done from Ainslie Point Road starting on the same route as the Mount Norman trail. The trail climbs steadily at the beginning, then descends steeply, before following a route just above the shoreline to the campsites and beaches. Begin your hike at the metal gate and the wooden sign with a map of the park. Follow the gravel trail as it climbs steeply as you quickly gain elevation. The trail will reach a sign where you go right to Beaumont Marine Park (left goes to Mount Norman). After the junction, continue uphill as the trail passes through forest before veering right. The route then goes around some rocks and suddenly drops past some large boulders before beginning a long descent. Continue to follow the trail downhill through a few steep sections before it eases, while continuing to descend through the forest. The trail will eventually reach the bottom but you will be above the shoreline as it veers to the left and heads towards the beach areas. There is a steep path down to the water for a quick viewpoint of Bedwell Harbour. Follow the trail above the shoreline as you make fairly quick time. At a junction, go right and use the trail that is closer to the water. You will hike through a forested grove before reaching the first campsite. Go right at the campsite and walk out on the beach for some scenic views of the harbour. Return to the campsite and take the trail to the right as it goes to an outhouse next to a junction. Go right at the junction and continue hiking along the route, occasionally seeing views of the water. The trail reaches a second campsite above the shoreline and continues through it to an end point where there are stairs down to the beach. Walk down to the beach an enjoy the views of Bedwell Harbour. After exploring the marine park, return via the same route that you arrived, passing through the campsite and following the trail. When you reach the junction near the outhouse, this time, go right and following the forest trail further from the water as it's slightly quicker to return this route. After passing the second junction where the trails join, continue to follow the path above the shoreline. Then the trail veers right and the steep climb uphill begins as you hike through the forest and eventually up past the boulders. The trail rounds the corner, then gradually descends down to the junction. If time permits, it's well worth the hike to Mount Norman to see the viewpoint. Otherwise, go left and hike back down the gravel trail to where you began."
Belcarra Bluffs,3.8,Tri Cities,Intermediate,3.0,6.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/belcarra-bluffs/,"The Belcarra Bluffs viewpoint overlooks the entrance to Indian Arm, peering across towards Deep Cove in North Vancouver, to the left towards Capital Hill in Burnaby, and downtown Vancouver in the distance. The hike begins from Belcarra Regional Park and can be done as a loop, returning via the Admiralty Point Trail. Although the trails to Belcarra Bluffs are well defined, the route is not well marked and it can be easy to miss a junction and get confused. Leave yourself extra time. From the parking lot at Belcarra Regional Park, walk towards the left side of the building with the bathrooms. Look for a wooden sign post that marks the direction of the Springboard Trail and follow the path as it leaves the grassy section of the park. A short distance, and you reach a gravel driveway. Cross the driveway and continue on the Springboard Trail. The Springboard Trail will weave through the forest as it gains elevation at a semi-comfortable pace. Count the switchbacks as you follow the trail and after passing the 3rd switch back (the 3rd one curves left), watch for a wooden park sign that marks the Springboard Trail. About 10-15 metres beyond this sign, look for an unmarked trail on the right that heads up into the forest. Follow the forested trail as it climbs quickly. When you reach a junction, go left and follow the trail, down over some loose rocks before it veers right and continues to climb again. There are no trail markers, however the trail is well defined up until the next junction. After walking up a somewhat steep hill, the trail will begin to level as you enter an open area of trees with minimal bushes or lower, green vegetation. Watch for an unmarked 4-way junction and go right. It's difficult to find this junction but follow the worn path as it descends slightly and you will notice the route passes around fallen trees and becomes much more defined as a trail after a couple of minutes. The trail continues until it goes downhill and reaches another junction. Take note of this junction as you will return to this point and can take the trail to the left to descend towards Admiralty Point later. Go right and continue descending down the steep hill. The trail rounds a corner and you walk out onto Belcarra Bluffs with the incredible view right in front of you. On a clear day, you can see the buildings in downtown Vancouver from Belcarra Bluffs. In addition, views of the entrance to Indian Arm, across towards Deep Cove and Burnaby to the left. Return by walking back up the trail the way that you arrived until you get to the junction. Go right at the junction to return a different way via the Admiralty Point Trail. Follow the trail a short distance and go right at the first junction. The trail descends through a steep section, so be careful and watch your footing. When the trail levels and reaches a junction, go left at the 3-way junction and continue downhill. Watch closely for a trail on the right as you descend. This junction is easy to miss and it's at a point where the trail appears to go to the left, but there is also a trail on the right. If you miss this right, you will still reach the Admiralty Point Trail but you will be further away. After going right at the junction, the trail passes through a section with ferns on both sides as it makes its final descent before reaching the Admiralty Point Trail. Once on the Admiralty Point Trail, go right and walk about 2km along the trail as it follows near the shoreline before returning to the grassy park area where you began your hike."
Bert Flinn Park,4.7,Tri Cities,Easy,1.0,2.6,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/bert-flinn-park/,"Bert Flinn Park in Port Moody has a number of scenic hiking trails that pass through lush forests and make for a short, easy walk. The route passes several streams and raised boardwalks and is a popular area for locals and dog walkers. There are a variety of trails and the easiest ones to follow are to the north of the park. The description below will follow those trails and then loop back along the wide gravel trail. For those wanting a longer hike, there are trails to the south to explore but the trails are not well marked and can be confusing as they pass between neighbourhood developments. From the wide gravel trail to the west of the roundabout at David Avenue and Heritage Mountain, walk up onto the gravel area on the right and follow a trail that heads up into the forest. Immediately, you enter a beautiful west coast forest with cedars and Douglas fir trees as the trail gently climbs uphill. Cross over a small wooden bridge and a bit further you reach a clearing. Walk past the clearing and continue along the trail on the other side, quickly making time until you reach another clearing with a sign marking the Wetlands ahead. Go left and into the forest as the next section of trail makes its way around the wetlands, crossing a series of boardwalks, before reaching the clearing on the far side. Walk up the old gravel road to a 3-way junction and next to an old, blank wooden signboard. Go left past the old signboard and stay left at the small junction as you follow the trail and it begins to descend. The route drops down and crosses a bridge before continuing through the lush forest. Eventually you reach a junction and it is at this point that you need to decide whether to loop back to the beginning or to extend your hike and taking the longer route (explained below). Go left and walk a bit further to where the trail opens up and joins the wide gravel trail. Follow the wide trail, staying on the straight route as it takes you all the way back to the start of the trail. This section is a dog-off-leash area so expect to run into a few dogs as you return to the trailhead.Longer RouteThe trails along the southern area of Bert Flinn Park are also beautiful and offer a longer route to explore but they are not well marked and can be a bit confusing. You are never far from a neighbourhood, however where you end up and what junction to take is part of the challenge.To access these trails, go right at the junction on the trail just before reaching the clearing with the wide trail and follow it, staying left at a second junction and continuing until it reaches a gravel clearing. Pass straight through the gravel clearing and cross a wide gravel road, entering the forest on the other side.Alternatively, you can also follow the wide trail for about 100-meters to where a separate wide trail heads off to the right, going downhill and follow that. If you are following the wide gravel trail downhill, watch for a clearing to your right and, immediately to your left enter the trailOne you've entered the forest, follow the trail, staying left at the first junction. At the 2nd junction, go left and head uphill to where the trail arrives behind a row of houses. Follow the trail for awhile until it reaches the end of the houses, then go left up the hill with the houses to the left. The trail reaches a road where there is a bench. Cross the road and follow the trail on the other side as it continues uphill and eventually reaches the wide gravel trail near where you began.

Big Cedar and Kennedy Falls Trail,4.1,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.0,10.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/big-cedar-and-kennedy-falls-trail/,"The survival of the Big Cedar Tree is at risk due to significant erosion that has been ocurring around the base of the tree. Please protect the tree by not getting too close. For more information, read this article from theBC Tree Hunter. The Big Cedar and Kennedy Falls trail in North Vancouver is a rugged hike into the backcountry along the east side of Mount Fromme and to the west of Lynn Creek. The trail passes an enormous old-growth cedar tree, with several trees growing out of it, before heading further north to a spectacular waterfall called Kennedy Falls. While the trail has less elevation gain compared to many North Shore trails, the route itself is quite rugged with lots of roots, slippery creek crossings, muddy hills, and numerous fallen trees to climb over or under. Pay extra attention to the trail markers as it can be easy to lose the trail in some sections where there is a lot of deadfall. From the parking lot, walk to the far end and head down into the forest to the hiking trail. Follow the trail as it stays parallel to the Old Grouse Mountain Highway for the first section. At the junction, go straight and within the next 15 meters, go right at the second junction staying on the Big Cedar Trail. Continue along the trail as it crosses a nice wooden bridge as you begin to leave the mountain bikers behind. The trail continues along the route, quickly coming to the first creek crossing. Be careful as you make your way down the slippery section into the creek bed before crossing and climbing up the other side. Continue along the trail as it passes through the forest and gradually descends along the rocky path. Through the entire route to Kennedy Falls, you will notice plenty of evidence of logging operations including some metal tools and lots of wooden cross ties along the path that were used to help bring the logs out of the forest.After about 1 hour and 30 minutes, you reach the enormous tree known as the Big Cedar Tree. It's one of the only trees not to be logged in the area and is supposedly about 600-years old, giving a good idea of what the forest would have looked like had it not been logged.After viewing the tree, continue heading northward as the trail climbs uphill from the Big Cedar Tree, crossing another fallen tree along the way. The route continues through the beautiful forest for about 30-minutes until you reach an area where there are lots of old wooden ties from the logging operations. Zig-zag your way through, following the worn route. Shortly after, the trail opens up into a rough stretch, passing through an old landslide with lots of debris to step over and around. Continue down through the rocky section and then up and over a small dirt mound to where the creek comes into view with Kennedy Falls just up to the left.The area around Kennedy Falls can be quite cold as it gets little sunlight, being located on the northern side of Mount Fromme. You can walk up along side the river to get a really good view of the falls but be careful as the mist from the waterfall can make the rocks slippery. Find a nice place nearby to enjoy a break and snack before heading back.Return via the same route you came, carefully hiking the rugged terrain and being sure to watch for trail markers. Pass the Big Cedar Tree and look for the coloured ribbons on the other side that lead over the fallen trees and back onto the trail. Around a couple of hours from the waterfall, you may encounter the occasional mountain biker, giving a good indication that you are almost back at the beginning of the trail.

Black Mountain Cabin Lake Loop,5.0,The North Shore,Intermediate,2.5,6.0,July - September,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/black-mountain-cabin-lake/,"The hike to Black Mountain and Cabin Lake from the Cypress Mountain Ski Resort area in West Vancouver is a relatively short, steep hike with scenic views of the area, including a view of the Lions in the distance from the Yew Lake Lookout. Cabin Lake is calm and a popular place to take a swim in during the hot summer days. The trail to Black Mountain follows the Baden Powell Trail and is located in Cypress Provinial Park. The route begins beyond the Black Mountain Lodge, to the left of the wooden map board. Walk towards the Eagle Express chairlift and follow a trail just to the right of the chair lift. The trail will enter the forest and reach a junction where you continue to the left. Shortly after, there will be a second junction next to a small bridge over Cypress Creek, go left (do not cross the bridge) and this is when the uphill section begins. The trail is well defined and easy to follow as the Baden Powell is marked with unique markers on the trees with the letters ""BP"". Continue to follow the trail, vocationally glancing back to see some of the views across the bowl. The trail passes through a series of switchbacks, then climbs up some rocky steps next to a ski run, before passing a small pond and contuing. The trail eventually reaches a junction with a wooden sign. Go right and walk a short distance, continuing along the wooden boardwalks and to the right where Cabin Lake is located. The beautiful lake is calm as the surrounding scenery and sunlight reflect off of it. Before leaving the Cabin Lake area, it's worth hiking up to the Yew Lake Lookout as it has the best view in the area. The Yew Lake Lookout, also known as the north peak of Black Mountain, follows a trail located about 10 metres back along the wooden boardwalks in the direction you walked from. There is a wooden sign post at the start of the Yew Lake Lookout trail and the trail heads uphill into the trees quickly as you make your way up over the loose rocks. It's a short hike as you arrive at the ridge with scenic views of the Lions in the distance between the trees. Walk to the other side for glimpses of views towards the city. Return to the trail near Cabin Lake and, this time, leave the lake by walking along the wooden boardwalk in the direction you haven't been, heading towards Black Mountain (the South Peak). Continue to follow the Baden Powell Trail and within about 10-minutes, you arrive at the south peak of Black Mountain. Continue your hike as the trail descends, passing Owen Lake and arriving at a junction. The longer hike to Eagle Bluffs goes to the right, however to complete the loop and head back to the Cypress Mountain parking area, go left. Follow the trail as it passes Sam Lake and Theagill Lake. Just after these lakes, go left at a junction and continue towards cabin lake where a short distance later, you reach the junction where you passed earlier. Go right at the junction and begin hiking down the hill along the same route you hiked up earlier, carefully watching your step on some of the loose rock and steep sections. Stay to the right at the junctions near Yew Lake as you return to the chairlift and the Black Mountain Lodge."
Black Tusk,4.8,Whistler,Difficult,11.0,29.0,July - October,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/black-tusk/,"A free day-use pass is required from the Rubble Creek trailhead fromJune 13 to October 13, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. The dark, jagged edges of Black Tusk make it one of the most scenic and unique hikes in southwestern British Columbia. Located in Garibaldi Provincial Park, Black Tusk is the most spectacular mountain in the area. While many hikers do complete this trail in a day, the distance and elevation gain make for a very long day. For this reason, some people prefer to hike to Garibaldi Lake or Taylor Meadows and camp overnight, and then hike to Black Tusk the following day. It is up to you which you prefer, however if you do decide to do this in a day, make sure to leave plenty of time to return to the parking lot during daylight hours. Start your hike from the wooden steps in the upper section of the Rubble Creek parking lot. The dirt trail climbs steadily for the first 6km until you reach a junction. Going right takes you to Garibaldi Lake, so take the trail to the left to head up towards Taylor Meadows and eventually on to Black Tusk. The trail continues to climb gradually eventually emerging from the forest and into more wide open space as you enter into Taylor Meadows. Continue along the trail as it enters into the Taylor Meadows campsite area. Pass the camping area and continue along the trail as it meanders through the meadows. In the late summer and early fall, the alpine flowers are in full bloom and their beautiful colours are scattered across the land like a beautiful piece of art. Eventually, you arrive at a junction with a map and wooden bench. Continue going straight along the trail for a short distance and watch for a sign and trail on your left that point the way to Black Tusk. Take this trail and immediately start your uphill trek. The trail climbs quickly, passing over small runoff streams and evidence of rockslides that have occurred over thousands of years. As you gain elevation, look back occasionally at the view of Garibaldi Lake below. As the trail continues, the trees and vegetation become fewer eventually giving way to a completely rocky terrain. The trail emerges onto a small ridge at a BC Parks sign with a full view of Black Tusk ahead of you. From this point on, BC Parks does not maintain a trail, however evidence of a path is still visible from the many hikers who trek through here each year. The next section of trail is a scramble over loose shale towards the base of the Tusk. Read the BC Parks sign carefully and understand that continuing further is at your own risk. Passing the BC Parks sign will begin with a steep uphill climb. The loose shale slides with each step you take making it seem like you slide back one step for every two steps you move forward. The trail eventually emerges onto a ridge next to the base of the Tusk that offers a scenic view of the entire area surrounding Garibaldi Lake. Be careful on the loose rocks as some of the cliffs in the area are high enough to cause very serious injuries or even death. Most hikers end their hike to the Tusk at this point before heading back. Although it is possible to make it onto the peak of the Tusk it is not recommended as it is extremely dangerous and discouraged by BC Parks. However, it is sometimes attempted by experienced rock climbers with the proper equipment and training. To reach the chute that you can climb to the top, follow the base of the Tusk, stepping carefully to make sure you don't slide down the hill. The shale is very loose and pulling yourself up through the chute generally pulls off pieces of rock from the Tusk. Even experienced rock climbers must keep in mind that they have to come back down this same route. After enjoying the view, it's time to head back down the way you came. Without a clear trail or markings, watch for worn areas of the trail where other hikers have been and aim for the large BC Parks sign that you passed on your way up. Once at the BC Parks sign the trail markings appear as does the vegetation. Continue back down the path towards Taylor Meadows and go right when you reach the junction of the main trail. Back at the Taylor Meadows junction, it is possible to do a side trip to Garibaldi Lake and return a different route to the parking lot if time permits. If you're short on time, go straight through Taylor Meadows, back the way you came to the first junction. However, if you have a bit of extra time and energy, go left towards Garibaldi Lake. After a bit more walking through the meadows and a downhill section through a series of switchbacks that head down to the lake, a trail appears on the left. Follow the trail as it merges with the river and cross the bridge to the other side. Walk along the lake side to the clearing to see a full view of the lake and glacier. On a hot day, the cold water of Garibaldi Lake can feel nice to dip your feet into. After you have rested and taken in the lake view, head back towards the bridge crossing the river and back up the steep dirt trail. Turn left at the sign and continue for the next 3km, passing two smaller lakes before reaching the first junction. From this junction, continue straight for the next 6km back towards the Rubble Creek parking lot. The sound of Rubble Creek far below starts to get louder as you near your destination."
Blackcomb Meadows,4.0,Whistler,Intermediate,3.0,8.0,July - October,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/blackcomb-meadows/,"Before the chairlifts were opened for the summer and the Peak-to-Peak gondola was built, the hiking trails on Blackcomb were difficult to access. The beautiful, alpine area is now accessible and hikers can easily reach the scenic Blackcomb Lake and viewpoints from a ridge looking towards Overlord Glacier. From the area around Rendezvous, at the top of the Solar Coaster Chairlift and next to the Peak-to-Peak Gondola, hike up the gravel hill and follow the start of the well defined trail. The first section of trail is an easy trail known on the Blackcomb maps as Alpine Walk. After the short initial hill, the trail levels and you enjoy views of the Fitzsimmons Valley. The trail reaches a rocky area with a clear viewpoint across the valley to Whistler. A few steps up the rocky section, there is a junction. Go right and take the Overlord Trail as it makes its way through the alpine before descending a steep hill. Just after the steep hill and under the 7th Heaven Chairlift, there is a major 5-way junction. Take the Lakeside Loop Trail on the left (note: the trail on your ""hard"" left is called the Marmot Trail. This is a steep side-route that climbs and offers additional views of Fitzsimmons Valley, however most will find it more work than it's worth). Follow the Lakeside Loop Trail through the sub-alpine trees a short distance and the trail opens up into a large clearing. Only a few more minutes up the trail and Blackcomb Lake appears with an incredible, scenic backdrop from the surrounding mountains. After enjoying the views at the lake, continue along the trail as it passes the lake and descends downhill, passed through the meadows and over small streams. The trail eventually meets the Overlord Trail. Go left and follow the trail as it climbs slightly. A short 10 minutes later, go left at the junction and follow the Decker Loop Trail as it begins to climb quickly. This section of trail is fairly steep as it follows a ridge up to the viewpoint that looks towards the Overlord Glacier. After enjoying the view, continue following the Decker Loop Trail as it descends quickly and joins the Overlord Trail near a lake. Continue hiking around the lake as the difficult sections are behind you and the trail becomes much easier. After 15 minutes or so, pass the junction with the Decker Trail, continuing on the Overlord Trail, and begin your hike back towards the chairlifts at Roundezvous. At the junction with the Lakeside Loop Trail, this time go left and continue along the Overlord Trail as you take the bottom section of the loop back. Not long after, you reach the major junction under the 7th Heaven Chair. Follow the trail you took earlier, continuing along the Overlord Trail, as you now have to head up the steep hill before passes through the alpine area and reaching the junction with the Alpine Walk. Go right at the junction and follow the easy trail as a short time later, it opens up to where the Gondola and chairlifts are. A short walk down the ski hill and the last section of trail returns you to the Rendezvous chalet."
Bosumarne Falls,4.4,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,2.5,April - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/bosumarne-falls/,"Bosumarne Falls is a scenic waterfall that's a short hike from a few kilometers from the end of Chilliwack Lake Road. There is a small lower falls but it's the upper falls that is the most spectacular as the water cascade from the rocks high above. While the trail is rated as easy, there is a challenge creek crossing over a bouncy log bridge with no railings and the upper section of the trail is really rugged and slippery. Use caution when crossing the bridge and don't do it if you don't feel comfortable. From the starting point along Chilliwack Lake Road, follow the old logging road as it it passes between trees before reaching a large clearing. Continue to follow the road as it veers to the left and gradually heads uphill. At the end of the old logging road, follow a worn trail with occasional markers into the forest. After entering the forest, just a mere 20 meters or so straight ahead is the lower falls. This waterfall is quite small but still worth seeing before hiking up to the upper falls. Return to the trail and follow the route uphill as there are occasional flagging markers to help guide the way. The trail climbs steeply through the lush forest as the moisture from the creek and waterfall make for ideal conditions for plenty of moss covered trees and rocks. Not far up the trail, you arrive at a bridge made of four small logs tied together and partially wrapped in metal for grip. Be very careful crossing this bridge as there are no railings, the bridge is very bouncy, and falling will easily lead to an injury. After crossing the bridge, follow the trail up over the rocks and a log stairway as you make your way up the rugged route with glimpses of Bosumarne Falls ahead. The end of the trail is next to the pool where the waterfall drops into from the rocks above. After enjoying the waterfall, carefully make your way back down the rocks, the log stairway, and across the bridge. Walk back down through the forest and watch for the worn trail to your left that leads back to the clear. Follow the old logging road back downhill and out to Chilliwack Lake Road where you began."
Boundary Bay Regional Park,4.1,Tsawwassen and Delta,Easy,2.0,5.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/boundary-bay-regional-park/,"Boundary Bay Regional park is located south of Vancouver near the border with the United States and is a popular bird watching area for nature enthusiasts. There is a long trail that wraps around a large portion of Boundary Bay, however we will focus on an area known as the 12th Avenue Dyke Trail. This area includes Centennial Beach and a Wildlife Reserve area. Bring your binoculars and take your time enjoying the wildlife in the area. From the parking lot at Centennial Beach, walk out towards the beach and along the main 12th Avenue Dyke Trail trail to the left. Follow the trail until you reach a wooden signboard with a map of the area at a junction with the Dune Trail. The Dune Trail is a short trail that loops out towards the water before returning to the main path a short distance later. Back on the 12th Avenue Dyke Trail, follow the route as it veers to the right, passing the junction with the Raptor Trail on the left. The gravel path follows alongside the beach of Boundary Bay offering many opportunities to view a variety of ducks and other waterfowl. The trail eventually reaches a junction where a viewing platform stands. Climb the steps of the platform for a better look at the region. Continue walking along the shores of the bay until you reach a junction with a set of stairs on the left to the Raptor Trail. Walk down the set of stair, cross the bridge, and follow the narrow dirt trails. This area of the park is a protected nature reserve and is the home of many species of birds, including eagles, ducks, and much more. The first section seems like a maze of trails but they mostly end up in the same place. Follow the trails and continue to where they meet. Loop back through the park along the Raptor Trail until it reaches a junction with boards on the left. Stay to the right and either continue following the Raptor Trail to where it meets up with the 12th Avenue Trail or walk up a small dyke hill on the right to the Savannah Trail and go left back towards the parking lot."
Bowen Lookout,4.5,The North Shore,Easy,1.5,4.0,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/bowen-lookout/,"The Bowen Lookout is an incredible viewpoint that is located near the Cypress Mountain ski area and overlooks Howe Sound, out towards Bowen Island. The hike is relatively short, with a steep climb and is often done as a short side-trip on the way toSt Mark's Summit. From the downhill ski area at Cypress, walk past the lodge and continue to the trail map located at the far end. Start the trail to the right of the trail map board and walk down the gravel trail as it heads into the forest. Almost immediately, you reach a junction with the Howe Sound Crest Trail East. You can go either route as both trails take you to the Bowen Lookout, however this description will go right and then come back along the other route. Go right and follow the trail uphill briefly to where it exits onto the side of a ski run and continues climbing. When you reach a large water tower, there is a junction with the Howe Sound Crest Trail to the right. Do not take this trail, instead go to the left and walk around the water tower, following the wide, level path as you quickly make time. Along the wide path, you will pass a junction to the left with a sign. Note this junction as you will return via this route. Continue along the wide path as it narrows and then reaches a wooden bridge where it veers to the right. This is where the trail begins to really climb. Follow the gravel path as it climbs steeply through a series of switchbacks until it reaches a sign with the junction to the Bowen Lookout. Go left at the sign and walk down the hill to the end, where you are greeted with a scenic view looking out towards Howe Sound and Bowen Island. After enjoying the view, retrace your steps by walking back up the hill to the main trail, then go right as you begin to descend quickly through the switchbacks. Cross the wooden bridge and veer to the left, following the path as it begins to widen. Watch for a trail sign on your right and go right at that junction towards Yew Lake (note: Dogs are not permitted on this trail and you will have to continue straight, going back the way you came). Immediately there is another junction but this is a very small loop within the forest, so you can go either way. At the other end of the forested loop, take the trail out of the forest and pass by a bog where the trail then joins with the Yew Lake Loop Trail. For the quickest route back to the trailhead, go left and walk along the gravel path and before long, you return to the area with the map where you began. For a slightly longer route, go right and walk around Yew Lake, returning to the same area next to the map."
Brae Island Regional Park,3.0,Surrey and Langley,Easy,1.0,4.2,year-round,True,False,True,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brae-island-regional-park/,"The short walk to Tavistock Point on Brae Island offers scenic views of the surrounding Fraser River and distant Coastal Mountain range. The route is a wide gravel trail that is perfect for families and campers staying at theFort Campingcampsite. From the gravel parking lot, walk past the map of the area and along the gravel trail as it follows along the boundary with the campsite. After passing the end of the campsite, the trail briefly follows near the shoreline before reaching an open picnic area. Continue along the wooded trail until you reach a 4-way junction. Go left for a short walk to view the first viewpoint of the Fraser River on the west side of the island. Return to the trail and go left towards Tavistock Point. A short distance later, you reach another junction with a short trail on your left to the second viewpoint. After checking out this view, return to the trail and walk past the Tavistock Loop junction, continuing a short distance to the end of the trail. Tavistock Point marks the northern tip of Brae Island and on a clear day has scenic views of the Fraser River and both shorelines. Once you've soaked in the view, walk back along the trail to the Tavistock Loop junction and go left for an alternate return route. Not far along, you reach a view point of the distant Coastal Mountain range. Continue walking along the loop as it weaves through the forest and across small wooden bridges before meeting up with the main trail. Go left at the junction and walk back, passing the picnic tables and alongside the campsite before reaching the gravel parking lot."
Brandywine Falls,4.0,Whistler,Easy,0.5,1.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brandywine-falls/,"Brandywine Falls is a perfect stop for those traveling through the Squamish, Whistler area looking for a short walk to a spectacular falls. The trail starts from the parking lot and crosses a covered wooden bridge. After crossing the river, head right, just 500m (1640 feet), crossing train tracks along the way, until you reach the platform overlooking the magnificent view of the waterfall. The falls itself drops approximately 70m and the surrounding cavern features rockslides that have crumbled from the walls over hundreds of years. The trail continues a short distance past the platform for a view of Daisy Lake."
Brandywine Meadows,4.2,Whistler,Difficult,3.5,6.0,July - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brandywine-meadows/,"Located just south of Whistler, the hike to Brandywine Meadows brings you to a scenic meadow with a calm creek that meanders through the grass, and surrounded by picturesque mountains and glaciers. If you time it right towards the end of the summer, the meadows will be full of the colourful sights and smells of wildflowers. Don't let the short distance and time lead you to believe that this is an easy hike. The trail has an average grade steeper than other hikes in the area, such as Wedgemount Lake and Black Tusk. Most of the steep section of trail occurs during the first kilometer. From the brown ""Brandywine Meadows"" BC Parks sign, walk into the forest and look for the trail and orange marker. The trail can at times feel difficult to follow so make sure to look up for the markers on the trees. Continue as the trail begins to climb steeply, crossing over fallen trees and slippery rocks. After 20 minutes of hiking, the trail veers away from the creek but continues its relentless climb up the mountainside. After an hour or so, the trail follows alongside the treeline where an adjoining section of trail has been more recently logged. The trail stays within the trees, passing through a section that is often very muddy. Carefully pass over the wooden planks as you maneuver your way through this section. After crossing a final stream and making your way up a final steep section, the trees begin to thin as you make the final approach to the meadows. At a junction, go left and continue as the mountains gradually come into view before reaching some large rocks where you can look down into the meadows and up at the surrounding mountains. You have reached Brandywine Meadows and this is a good point to stop for a rest and something to eat. If you would like to continue your hike, it is possible to hike up Brandywine Mountain starting from the other side of the creek. Once you are satisfied with your time in the meadows, make your way back to the trail as you take in a scenic view of Black Tusk in the distance on a clear day. Make sure to go right at the junction and continue down the steep hill, through the muddy section, and the other steep hill until you reach the trailhead where you started."
Bridal Veil Falls,3.2,Fraser Valley East,Easy,0.25,0.8,May - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/bridal-veil-falls/,"Bridal Veil Falls Provincial Park is a great day-use park with a picnic area for families and highlighted by a short walk to a waterfall that cascades down the rocks from 60 meters above. The name of the park comes from the waterfall as it's smooth rock is said to create a ""veil like"" effect from the falling water. There are two short trails from the parking lot to the waterfall and it's best to do both as a loop. From the parking lot walk to the picnic area and alongside the creek as the trail becomes to climb uphill through the forest. After climbing for 5 minutes, the trail passes over a wooden bridge across the creek and continues uphill as the sound of the waterfall starts to become evident. A few more steps and you arrive at the wooden railings of the viewpoint for the waterfall. You can either return via the route you came or take the Woodland Trail back as it too will end up at the parking lot area. To take the Woodland trail, immediately after leaving the viewpoint area, go right at the junction and down the wooden steps and back onto the dirt trail. A junction to your left takes you to the picnic area of the park. Go straight and continue along the Woodland Trail as it wraps around the bottom forested section of the park and returns back to the parking lot."
Brohm Lake,3.7,Howe Sound,Intermediate,5.0,7.5,April - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brohm-lake/,"April 5, 2024 - The wooden bridge crossing Brohm Lake is closed indefinitely due to rot and damage. Plans are being made to replace the bridge but no timeline has been provided and the bridge will likely be closed all of 2024. If you have traveled the Sea To Sky Highway to Whistler, than you have passed, and probably noticed, the Brohm Lake Interpretive Forest just north of Squamish, BC. Set amongst a beautiful lush, quiet forested, the region has a number of trails that circle the lake, climb up to viewpoints overlooking the Cheakamus River, and even access the Paradise Valley area. From the main parking lot, this description will do a counter-clockwise loop around the lake and take the longer route around the High Trail and Cheakamus Loop Trail before returning back via the wooden bridge. For those wanting a longer route, exploring the Thompson Trail down to Paradise Valley and the Hatchery is an option but make sure to allow 1.5 - 2 hours of extra time as the trail is not included in this description  and is very steep. Walk towards the main wooden signboard and go right a few steps to a junction to the outhouses. Go right towards the outhouses and take a quick left before reaching them and you will find yourself following a trail uphill as it winds its way through the forest and around the rocks. Continue your hike along the trail, staying on the main route as the trail climbs and descends through wooden steps. After crossing a couple of wooden bridges, you will reach a marker with the Brohm Creek Trail. As of 2012, the trail is accessible, however the Powerline Trail shown on maps in the area is heavily overgrown and too difficult to use. Go left at the junction and a short distance later, you reach the junction with the Thompson Trail. The Thompson Trail is a steep route that connects to the Paradise Valley area. Go left at this junction and continue walking around the Brohm Lake trail. The route continues meandering through the forest, offering occasional glimpses of the lake before reaching a junction with the Connector Trail. Go right up the steep slope for a short distance to another junction that meets with the High Trail. Take the long route by going right to yet another junction with the Tantalus View Trail that climbs steeply to a fairly overgrown view of the Tantalus Mountain Range. Back on the main trail, walk along the High Trail as it curves and drops down a few steps before passing through a somewhat overgrown area and reaching an old logging road. This marks the start of the Cheakamus Loop Trail to the right (note: if you want a shorter route, following the old logging road will connect you to the end of the Cheakamus Loop Trail). Along the Cheakamus Loop, the trail passes a picnic table, just off the trail in a clearing, before climbing quickly and passing several viewpoints overlooking the Squamish Valley and Tantalus Mountain Range. Continue following the well defined path, enjoying the quiet forest and all of the moss covered trees, before heading downhill and eventually rejoining the old logging road at a point further east. On the other side of the logging road, a few meters to the left in an area that's overgrown with plants, there is a sign marking the High Trail. Follow this trail as it gradually ascends out of the overgrown section and back into the forest before reaching a 3-way junction. At the junction, go right and just a few hundred meters, continue to the left passing the Alder Trail junction as you head back towards Brohm Lake. About 15 minutes later, the trail exists the forest onto a wooden bridge that crosses the lake and offers scenic views of the surrounding water and mountains. After crossing the bridge, go left and walk along the gravel trail next to the highway, taking in one last view of the lake on top of a rocky bluff, before reaching the parking lot area."
Brooks Point Regional Park,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,0.5,1.1,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brooks-point/,"Brooks Point is located on south Pender Island and has incredible views from its rocky shoreline across Boundary Pass to the San Juan Islands in the United States. The beach area is a great place to explore and often seals, whales, and other animals can be spotted from the shoreline. The trail to the shoreline is a short, east walk and great place for families to enjoy. From the trailhead at Gowland Point Road and Kloshe Road, walk past the park map and follow the wooden boardwalks through the lush vegetation. After only a few minutes, the trail reaches a junction next to some toilets. Go straight at the junction and follow the trail as it quickly leaves the forest. Walk to the far right and up onto the rocky Gowland Point where there are scenic coastal views of Drummond Bay and Boundary Pass. Walk back in an eastward direction along the shoreline, following an unmarked route. There are a few access point to the rocky beach area which can be explored, particularly during low tide. Continue eastward along the path as it gently climbs and you walk towards a small automated lighthouse at the eastern section of the park. The views are equally as good as you look across to the San Juan Islands while the waves gently brush against the shore. To walk back from the lighthouse, follow a trail westward that pass through some grasslands. This trail weaves its way back into the forest and back to the junction next to the toilets. At the junction, go right and walk back along the boardwalks returning to the trailhead where you began your walk."
Brothers Creek Loop,4.1,The North Shore,Intermediate,4.0,7.0,April - November,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brothers-creek-loop/,"Brothers Creek Loop offers a beautiful hike through a forest of large Western Red Cedars along the mountainside in West Vancouver. After finding parking along the street, walk towards the gate and observe the private property sign and disclaimer. The land in this area is owned by British Pacific Properties Ltd. and they allow hikers to use the trails at their own risk. Continue past the fence and along the forest trail, catching remnants of old wooden rail ties in the ground once used by loggers to bring fallen trees out of the forest. After a short distance, you come to the Baden Powell Trail sign on your right. Do not take this trail, instead continue to your left, past the sign and continue walking up the rocky road to the next trail intersection. At this junction, go right and follow the Brothers Creek Fire Access Road as it makes its way up hill. On your right, a concrete foundation is all that remains of an old sawmill used during logging operations in the early 1900's. Continue along the trail until you reach a sign that points to the Crossover Trail. This is a shorter route perfect during the winter months when snow covers the trail at higher elevations. During the late spring, summer, and fall, continue making your way uphill to complete the entire loop. After another 20 minutes up the trail, you will reach a hairpin turn with a small sign that marks '5+6'. This is a short side trip that takes you to the Candelabra Fir, an old growth tree (now a dead snag) that is 60m tall and over 9m in circumference. Go straight for about 20 meters before heading right at the 'Candelabra Fir' sign and following the bright coloured trail markers downhill through the fallen trees. You cannot miss this monstrous tree that dwarfs all of the surrounding trees. This tree got this name because once its branches resembled a candelabra. A short trip beyond the Candelabra Fir brings you to another large snag of a Douglas Fir, not quite as large as the first, however still an amazing sight. After taking in the sites, head back up hill towards the main Fire Access Road. The trail continues wandering gradually uphill until you reach a bridge that crosses Brothers Creek. Cross over the creek and slowly make your way downhill. Keep an eye open to your left for occasional glimpses of two beautiful waterfalls tumbling down over the sharp, rocky cliffs. Continue to make your way back downhill as the trail wanders through groves of cedar trees. About 45 minutes downhill, you meet with the Crossover trail. Continue past this intersection for another 15 minutes until you meet with the Baden Powell Trail. Go left towards the open clearing and stay to your left, following underneath the power lines as you make your way back down towards Brothers Creek. The bridge crossing offers another beautiful view of a waterfall as water continuously rushes down at a torrent pace. Make your way up the other side of the river and follow the Baden Powell Trail eastbound for about 15 minutes until the trail meets with the Brothers Creek Fire Access Road intersection that you passed earlier in the day. Follow the rocky road downhill, past the Baden Powell sign on your left until you reach the fence and the Brothers Creek Loop trailhead."
Browne Creek Wetlands,0.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,0.75,3.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/browne-creek-wetlands/,"The Browne Creek Wetlands are located on the south side of the Vedder River in Chilliwack and are an important spawning channel that was built by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The trail offers a short walk, which can be combined with part of the Vedder River Trail. From the parking lot at the end of Browne Road, walk past the metal gate and follow the wide trail towards the Vedder River as you pass the Hopedale Slough waterway. Just before the Vedder Trail, there is a sign to the left and another trail marking the start of the trail for the Browne Creek Wetlands. Go left and follow this trail. Follow the path as it passes through the scenic marshland area until you reach a junction. Go left and pass by the open water pond on both sides of the trail as you continue along the gravel path. When you reach another junction, this is where the loop begins. Go right and begin the loop. Enjoy the scenic marshlands and keep an eye out for several types of birds, including the great blue heron. The trail will eventually reach a junction, where there is a wooden bridge to the right. Go left (not across the bridge) and follow the wide Bergman Road Trail. Just before it looks like you are heading to a parking lot, go left onto the Beaver Loop Trail and follow this route as it winds its way back to the junction you passed earlier. At this point, continue following the trail back along the direction you came from. Once you reach the junction near the open pond, you can go left and walk the short distance to the Vedder River to enjoy views of the river. Either continue walking along the Vedder River Trail in the direction you came from or return to the Browne Creek section and follow that trail back. Whichever trail you follow back, make sure you go right at the next junction as that trail will take you back to the parking lot where you began."
Brunswick Point,3.7,Tsawwassen and Delta,Easy,2.0,8.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brunswick-point/,"Located south of Vancouver in the suburb of Delta, Brunswick Point is a nice walk along the dikes of the Fraser River and a popular place for bird watchers. The trail starts where a metal gate marks the end of the road. From the parking area,  walk up onto the dike, passing the metal gate and following the gravel path. The trail follows the shoreline, passing some farmland on the left before arriving at a point with a wooden bench. This area is a great place for bird watchers to stop and stay still as they try to spot anything from a hummingbird to the American Kestrel. Brunswick Point is next to the neighbouring Westham Island, home to the Reifel Bird Sanctuary and dozens of different species of ducks and other coastal birds. Follow the path as it continues to cut between the marshy shoreline and the farms on the other side of the dike. On a sunny day, the farms on your left can be a scenic foreground amongst the mountains in the far-off distance while nature's beauty and man-made industry clash along the shore to your right, offering a stark contrast. After walking for over an hour and passing a few private property residences that join the path, a busy bridge with trucks and trains passing by appears up ahead. Just before reaching the bridge, a metal gate marks the end of the route. Turn around and retrace your steps back around Brunswick Point, returning to the metal gate where you began your walk."
Buntzen Lake,3.7,Tri Cities,Easy,3.5,10.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/buntzen-lake/,"BC Hydro requires aparking reservationfrom May 15 - September 1, 2025. The Buntzen Lake area is a popular recreation park that is maintained by BC Hydro that has a network of hiking trails to explore. The trail that loops around the lake is one of the most popular in the park as it passes through scenic forests, offers several views of the lake, crosses a suspension bridge, and passes the quieter beach at the north end. The following trail description follows the route around Buntzen Lake in a clockwise direction. From the parking lot, the easiest route is to start the trail from the southwest end of the parking lot, the opposite end of the parking lot from where the beach area is. There is a trail with a sign marking the Buntzen Lake Trail that leaves the parking lot and heads towards the floating bridge. Follow this trail as you leave the parking lot and continue straight, passing a trail to the right that comes from the beach area. At the sign at the next junction, go right and following the trail as you begin to catch glimpses of the south end of Buntzen Lake. When the trail joins another trail, go right and follow the route between the fence as you walk towards the floating bridge. After crossing the floating bridge, immediately go right and follow the wide, gravel access road that BC Hydro uses to access the pumphouse. Continue following the route as you pass a couple of junctions with the Saddle Ridge Trail but stay on the wide gravel road. Watch for a viewpoint of Buntzen Lake off to the right side of the trail as you walk through this area. Eventually, the wide gravel road ends at the pumphouse and the route becomes a narrow, hiking trail. Pass through the gate and follow the Lakeside Trail as you make your way through the scenic forest. The trail stays close to the lake for a bit before veering off into the forest and climbing steeply. There are several wooden bridges that cross small creeks. Enjoy the forest as you catch your breath on the uphill sections and quickly make time on the gradual downhill sections. The trail eventually veers back towards the lake again as it passes by an electrical tower. Watch your step on the loose rock as you make your way through this section. On the right, walk up onto a rocky bluff for a view across Buntzen Lake towards the North Beach and the tunnel that connects to Coquitlam Lake where water gushes out of. After enjoying the view, return to the trail and watch your step as the route descends again before reaching a junction. Go right at the junction towards the North Beach. Just after passing the junction, you reach the Suspension Bridge. Cross the bridge, enjoying the view of the lake and watching the water flow underneath you. Once on the other side, immediately walk to the right to where the North Beach is. This is a much quieter area than the beach near the parking lot and is a great place to stop to have a snack before heading back along the east side of the lake. After enjoying the views from the North Beach, follow the trail south from the beach area towards the sound of rushing water. There is a close-up view of the tunnel that brings water from Coquitlam Lake. After taking a quick look, follow the trail up the steep hill until you reach the gravel road at the top. Walk to your right and immediately follow the trail to the right as this will be the route that returns to the parking lot. The trail descends and passes over a couple of bridges as it weaves its way through the forest, offering views between the trees for much of the first half. The trail climbs through a section as you enjoy the beautiful forest before descending down through a switchback and crossing another wooden bridge. Continue your pace as the South Beach comes into view and the sound of dogs in the off-leash area can be heard up-ahead. Cross a final wooden bridge to the fence next to the dog off-leash area and immediate go left. Follow the gravel trail alongside the fence to the end of the dog area, then continue along the trail a short distance to where you return to the parking lot."
Burnaby Lake,3.4,Vancouver City,Easy,2.0,10.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/burnaby-lake/,"The largest lake in the Lower Mainland, Burnaby Lake has a rich ecology and is home to many species including ducks, geese, beavers, and much more. The lake also has a 10km hiking path that loops around the entire park area. Burnaby Lake has several access points, however we will start near the sports field where there is plenty of parking and easy access to Skytrain. From the parking lot, walk towards the Rugby Club building, pass it, and continuing along a small path on the grass field parallel to the road. When you reach the row of trees at the end of the grass field, go left onto the gravel road. Watch for a trail on the right that crosses a ditch and go right, following it towards the rowing pavilion. A short walk along the trail brings you to another parking lot. The trail continues straight ahead on the other side, however, a short detour to the left brings you to the rowing pavilion. The rowing pavilion has a rich history of hosting events, including the 1973 Canada Summer Games Event that was held in Burnaby and New Westminster. Due to the vegetation that has grown in the lake, large rowing events no longer take place here. Back on the gravel trail, continue a short distance to a junction and go left. The trail crosses a bridge and continues offering several views of the lake with the North Shore mountains in the background. The Wildlife Rescue Association, an organization that rehabilitates injured wildlife, is located nearby. The trail continues along the south side of the lake and eventually onto a series of boardwalks that cross a swampy area. A short distance along the gravel trail after the boardwalks brings you to a horse trail. Go left onto the wide horse trail and follow it north until a trail appears on the left just before a gravel parking lot. This is where the Burnaby Equestrian Centre is located. Go left onto the gravel trail and around the parking lot towards a grassy clearing and a dam. Cross the dam to the other side of the Brunette River and go left. Before the trail veers to the right, a bench offers a nice resting point with a view towards the lake. Continue your hike along the trail as you now walk along the north side of Burnaby Lake. A few junctions offer loops along side trails; ignore these and stay on the main trail. Eventually, you reach a small wooden bridge and the nature house. Go left and walk out onto Piper's Spit to admire all the ducks and geese that live in the area. This is not only a great place for scenic views of the lake but also for bird watching and nature photography enthusiasts to come to. Walk back to the main trail and a few steps further is another short side route. This one leads to a wooden viewing tower that offers great overhead views of the lake from the east to the west. Walk back to the main trail and continue as it winds along the north side of the lake before reaching a long stretch that runs parallel to the train tracks. At the end of this stretch, the trail veers sharply to the left and arrives at a wooden bridge crossing Still Creek. Depending on the time of day, beavers can sometimes be spotted swimming through the calm waters or foraging along the grassy shore. After crossing the bridge, keep to the right and a few steps further brings you to the parking lot where you began. To return to the Skytrain, walk to the road, go right, and follow it to the other side of the train tracks."
Burnaby Mountain,3.8,Vancouver City,Easy,3.0,7.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/burnaby-mountain/,"Located east of downtown Vancouver and home to Simon Fraser University, Burnaby Mountain has several trails that are popular with hikers and mountain bikers. The majority of the trails are on the east side of the mountain, just off of North Road near the Coquitlam boundary and they have different ratings according to their difficulty. There are many trails on Burnaby Mountain and one should plan their own route based on how long they want to spend outside. We have chosen a description below where the hike starts from the eastern edge of the Pipeline Trail along North Road and goes to the top of the mountain and back down, looping through several trails along the way. From the parking area, walk past the signboard with a map of the area and look for the North Road Trail that starts just 50 meters on your right. Take this trail and walk uphill, being careful for any mountain bikers riding downhill. Continue walking along this route as it cross several connecting paths that go from North Road to the Powerline Trail. 
Eventually, you will reach a crossing trail where there are several wooden ramps for bikers to ride across and do tricks. Go right and walk towards the fence. Make a left and walk alongside the fence and at the immediate junction, go left and follow the Dead Moped Trail as it winds its way through the forest of Burnaby Mountain. The Dead Moped Trail eventually reaches a 4-way crossing. Go straight for the longer version or go left for a shorter walk. Both will take you to the Trans Canada Trail, where you will go left and walk back up the hill towards the main map and signboard. Catch your breath at the signboard before following the Trans Canada Trail up the steep slope. The first junction up the steep hill is with Mel's Trail. At this point, you have to decide whether you want to hike up to the SFU Campus or just loop through the trails on Burnaby Mountain. We'll continue up the Trans Canada Trail towards SFU and take Mel's Trail on the way back down. The next junction is with Cardiac Hill, appropriately named for it's very steep slope. Go left at this junction and follow Cardiac Hill as it makes its way up to University Drive. Once at the top, go right and walk alongside the road towards the bus loop area where there are coffee shops and cafes. After your break, return to the trails by walking back along University Drive and down Cardiac Hill to the junction with the Trans Canada Trail. Go right and continue downhill to the junction with Mel's Trail. Go right onto Mel's Trail and up the steps as it climbs quickly before gradually levelling out and weaving through the forest. Cross the junction with the Gear Jammer Trail and continue heading west until you reach a junction with Nicole's Trail (also Poplar Trail to the right). Go left and walk down Nicole's Trail until you reach the bottom where it joins with the Pipeline Trail. Now you are at the bottom of the Pipeline Trail near where it meets Gaglardi Way. Go left and walk along the wide trail, crossing the wooden bridge before walking up the steep hill. Cross under the power lines and continue straight as it's a short distance back to North Road where you started your hike."

The hike is generally accessed year-round and the waterfall is best viewed during the winter and spring when there is more runoff flowing down the creek. Starting at the trail next to the metal gate, begin hiking uphill as you pass through an area that was recently logged. Just after passing a picnic table on the left, the trail veers to the right and enters the forest, following a much more scenic route. The path begins to climb at a steeper pace as you can hear the rushing water down, to your right. There is a wooden bench conveniently located part way up the hill to stop and also peer down into the canyon below. Continue following the path and within a few minutes, you reach the end where another wooden bench sits in front of a viewpoint of Burnett Falls. After enjoying the view of the falls, hike back downhill, making your way past the bench and out of the forest, passing the picnic table.

Only a small portion of the area on this sensitive eco-system is accessible to the public in an area on the eastern side called the Delta Nature Reserve. Raised boardwalks weave through the forested areas, passing over unique plants life created by the bog. From the Planet Ice parking lot, start the trail at the far end of the lot, near the Nordel Way overpass on the Surrey side. Go left and follow the brick pathway underneath the overpass and loop around to where you will see a wooden sign marking the start of the Nature Reserve. Follow the trail along the wide gravel path next to the slow moving stream. There are two main half-loops, a wide one and a smaller one. At the junction with the Peat Moss Meander on the right, go right onto the wooden boardwalks for the start of the wider half-loop. The trail immediately enters the thick wooded area surrounded by a wide range of plants and trees that make up the bog. Continue along these route, passing a junction by staying to the right. Eventually the trail reaches the wide gravel path again. Go left back towards Planet Ice. There are a number of trails with small bridges that cross the small stream that lead to the nearby houses on the other side of the train tracks. We will ignore these routes and walk along the wide gravel trail until we reach a trail on the left marking the start of the Tractor Trail. This is a much shorter half-loop but interesting for the half-visible tractor that is mostly submerged in the bog. There is one other boardwalk trail that connects the Peat Moss Meander with the Tractor Trail called the Skunk Cabbage Crawl. This route is short but there are lots of skunk cabbage alongside this trail in the spring. Be careful if the boardwalks are wet as this section does not have material on the wooden to help prevent your feet from slipping. Back on the wide gravel trail, go left and follow this path back towards Planet Ice, passing under the Nordel Way overpass before returning to the parking lot."
Campbell Valley Regional Park,3.9,Surrey and Langley,Easy,1.5,4.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/campbell-valley-regional-park/,"The Campbell Valley Regional Park in Langley is a large park located amongst farm land and with a sprawling network of trails for walking, horseback riding, and exploring. The park is also home to the Campbell Valley Downs Equestrian Centre and the historic Langley Speedway. Birdwatching, picnicking, and dog walking are also popular in the park as the easy terrain is perfect for families. From the circular parking lot, walking to the south end towards a map of the park. Take the trail on the right side and continue southbound as you stroll through the forest, passing the occasional open field. Continue along the trail until you reach the end, where the trail continues onto the South Valley Trail. Go left and onto the raised wooden boardwalks and in the middle, is a small section to walk out on to enjoy the view of the surrounding marsh. Continue walking along the wooden boardwalk to the other side and back onto the packed gravel trail. At the junction, go right for a 1km each direction side trip out to the old historic Langley Speedway. The Deer Trail passes through an open grassy meadow before passing through a set of trees and coming up on the old race track. The Speedway was an active race track in the 60's, 70's, and early 80's and is one of the few sites in BC to host Nascar events. Walking around the track, you can even see some of the damage along the walls that were caused by crashes. After checking out the Speedway, head back along the Deer Trail in the direction you came from, rejoining the Little River Loop Trail. The path leisurely heads back towards the parking, crossing a couple of wooden bridges, before exiting the scenic forest."
Capilano Canyon,3.6,The North Shore,Easy,1.0,2.6,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/capilano-canyon/,"Capilano Canyon is one of the Vancouver area's four canyons and offers splendid views of rushing water over rock nestled in a rainforest surrounding. There are several ways to access the Capilano River Regional Park but we will start our hike from Cleveland Dam off of Capilano Road. From the parking lot, make your way towards the dam, taking in the view of Grouse Mountain and the Lions off in the distance to your right. The Capilano Reservoir is one of Vancouver's main sources of drinking water and the area to the north of the dam is off limits to people. If you hear the sound of rushing water, the dam is open and you can stick your head over the side to see the water tumbling below into the canyon. After taking in the view of the dam, continue to the far side to a clearing where there are two wide trails on your left. Take the most right trail that heads uphill until it levels out and look for a trail on the left side behind a wooden gate. Walk into the forest along the Upper Shinglebolt Trail, enjoying the Hemlock and Fir trees that surround you. After a short walk, the trail begins to descend quite quickly. Once at the bottom, continue to your left and climb up over the roots of a tree where you will reach a fork in the trail. At this point, turn right and continue making your way downhill until after 5 minutes you reach another section where the trail forks. Go left and a short distance later you come to an intersection that meets with the Capilano Pacific Trail. Cross the trail and continue straight as the path stays fairly level for a brief time before descending even further into the canyon. After walking for about 10 minutes, you will have reached the bottom of this section where it meets with a wider gravel road. Walk up onto the dirt ridge on the other side and just off to the right, a short, narrow path takes you down towards a fence offering a view of the Capilano River far below. A few more steps to your right and you cross over the Pipe Bridge. For those who struggle with heights, this may be a quick crossing but for others, it may be a chance to take a few minutes (and photos) to enjoy the view of the swirling water below. After crossing the Pipe Bridge, a few meters up the gravel path is a trail to the left called the Coho Loop. Take this trail as it winds along the river offering occasional glimpses of the canyon to your left. About 15 minutes later, you will reach the Salmon Hatchery. This is a good chance to see some of the important work being done to preserve the salmon stocks in this region. The hatchery's interpretive center is open to the public everyday from 8am until closing times that vary seasonally according to how much daylight there is. A visit to the hatchery is free. To continue with the hike, walk out of the hatchery and look for the Palisades Trail on your left. Take this trail as you begin your climb back out of the canyon. After an uphill climb, you come to a dirt road that service vehicles use to access the dam area. The trail continues straight ahead, however we will turn left and follow the service road back up towards the dam instead. As you near the dam, there is a sign on your left that points the way to a viewpoint of the dam from below. Almost an hour ago, you were standing at the top of the dam looking down. Once you've taken in the view, walk back to the service road and continue walking uphill towards the dam. At the end of the trail and sitting against the dam is a set of stairs that will take you up and back to where you began earlier in the day."
Capilano Pacific Trail,3.6,The North Shore,Easy,4.0,15.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/capilano-pacific-trail/,"A section of the Capilano Pacific Trail is closed due to a landslide. The landslide occured near the access point to Moyne Drive. A detour route has been established, please follow signage for the detour around the landslide area. All trails further north in Capilano Regional Park are open. The Capilano Pacific Trail follows the Capilano River, the border of North and West Vancouver, from the sea up to Cleveland Dam where much of Vancouver's drinking water comes from. The route is 7.5km (2 hours) each way and passes a variety of terrain, including beaches, rocky shores, steep canyon cliffs, and dense west coast rain forest. From Ambleside Beach, walk east and start the hike by going underneath the train bridge and following the paved path towards the Park Royal Shopping Mall. Continue along the backside of the mall to the end of the pavement and onto a gravel trail that follows the Capilano River and passes several residences and businesses. The trail passes under the Marine Drive bridges and then over a wooden bridge that crosses the mount of Brothers Creek. Stay to the right on the other side of the bridge as it passes another residential building and then onto a trail that follows the river side. Watch for a sign pointing to the left for the Capilano Pacific Trail and go left up a dirt trail as it passes between several apartment buildings. This trail short trail will exit onto Keith Road at the intersection with 3rd Street. Go right along Keith Road, passing more apartments and houses for and the road will eventually pass underneath Highway #1 high above before continuing on a gravel road. The gravel road comes to a gate with a wooden map board on the right that shows all the trails within the Capilano area. Walk past the gate and continue along the wide gravel route as it gradually climbs uphill. Eventually, you will see a fenced in area to your right and often people walking around the trails inside. This is the Capilano Suspension Bridge. At the end of this fenced area, go right onto a dirt trail that enters the forest and down the steps as it veers to the left. This section of the hike is scenic and feels as though you are miles away from an urban area. Continue following the trail uphill as it passes over numerous wooden bridges with creeks below. To your right, there is a wooden viewing platform that gives a good glimpse of the steep slopes of the Capilano Canyon below. Back on the main trail and more thick forest, wooden bridges, and occasional glimpses of the river below. At a 4-way intersection, go straight and a short distance later, the trail exits onto a wide gravel road. Go left and up the steep route and emerge from the forest onto Cleveland Dam. After taking in the views from the dam, continue across to the North Vancouver side and find a place in the park to have lunch. You can either retrace your steps back down the route to Ambleside or take a bus from Capilano Road just beyond the parking lot back to Vancouver."
Cascade Falls,4.4,Fraser Valley East,Easy,0.5,0.75,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/cascade-falls/,"Located Northeast of Mission, BC, Cascade Falls is a scenic waterfall that can be viewed from a suspension bridge that crosses the river, just in front of the falls. The short walk uphill to the falls makes the long drive worth the trip. From the parking lot, walk towards the metal gate by the hill (note: sometimes the gate is not noticeable if it is open) and walk up towards a trail that begins on the right. Follow the trail up a steep hill as it winds to the right and within minutes you reach a set of wooden stairs. Climb the wooden stairs until you are just underneath the suspension bridge, where you get the first scenic view of Cascade Falls. Walk up the remaining stairs and cross the suspension bridge. During the early spring months and after a rainfall, an enormous amount of water flows over the rocks and into the canyon down below. Continue across the bridge to the wooden platform on the far side. The wooden platform is as close as you can get to the falls and when a lot of water is dropping into the canyon, you can feel the mist from this platform. After enjoying the view, cross back over the suspension bridge and walk back down the wooden stairs, returning to the parking lot via the gravel trail."
Channel Ridge South Trail,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,0.75,2.5,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/channel-ridge-south/,"The Channel Ridge Trails are a network of hiking and mountain biking trails on Salt Spring Island. The southern portion offers a beautiful forested walk with a slightly overgrown view of St. Mary Lake. From the trailhead on Merganser Place, walk past the metal gate and follow the dirt road into the forest. When the route reaches a sign with trails to the left, this is where you will need to ensure you follow the correct trail. Going straight looks like a trail but it is NOT a trail. The next trail to the left is the one you need to take. The further left one is the one you will return on. So, take the trail in the middle. Following the trail at the junction that's in the middle of the others, it continues uphill briefly to a water tower building, at which point the dirt road ends and becomes more of a trail. Follow the trail into the forest as it passes through lush west coast rainforest foliage, cedar trees, and Douglas fir trees. The trail reaches a bench with a viewpoint of St. Mary Lake to the right but the viewpoint is significantly overgrown. Continue to follow the trail as it gradually climbs up a rocky path. A short distance further, a small trail goes off to the right where a slightly better viewpoint of St. Mary Lake can be seen from above. Return to the trail and follow it uphill where it will reach another trail. Go left at this trail and the loop back to where you began. When the trail reaches a junction by a wooden bench, go left at the junction. Continue to follow the trail downhill and go straight through a 4-way junction. The route will eventually return to the first junction where with the dirt road where you began your loop earlier. Go right and follow the dirt road back to the metal gate along Merganser Place."
Chapman Falls,1.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,1.5,4.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/chapman-falls/,"Trail Closed due to active mining in the area. There is no access to Chapman Falls. Chapman Falls is a beautiful, multi-tiered waterfall that is located just south of Sechelt on the Sunshine Coast. Most of the views looking directly towards Chapman Falls are partially obstructed, however there are views of the upper section of the falls. The trail starts at a metal gate and follows a gravel road for 2km. This section is relatively boring as you follow the fairly straight road under some power lines that is used by industry to access the area. To begin the hike, walk over the dirt mound to the right of the metal gate and begin following the road. You will pass a work site to the the right and the entire section to your left will be protected by a barbed wire to prevent people from entering the quarry. When you reach the a small building with a sign that says ""Chapman Creek Booster Pump Station"", walk to the right of the building and follow the trail behind the building. The trail continues as you begin to hear the roar of Chapman Falls up ahead. Peer through the trees to see if you can catch a glimpse of the waterfall and it's multiple levels. There is one viewpoint where the trees are partially not blocking the view. There is no known safe trail down to the bottom of the waterfall as the sections surrounding the waterfall are extremely steep with sheer cliffs. The trail continues as it reaches two metal bridges. Cross both bridges and, just after the second bridge, look for a trail to the right that leaves the main trail and offers some views of Chapman Falls. Be VERY careful and do not venture too close to the edge as falling into the creek will likely prove to be fatal. Return to the trail and continue following it uphill until it branches off to the right where there are some views of the upper section of the waterfall and one of the pools along the rocky shoreline. The large metal pipe crosses the creek above. This is the end of the hike, however the trail does continue along a popular mountain biking trail known as the BLT Trail. There aren't any points of interest for hikers, so it's advised to turn around at this point. To return, follow the trail back in the direction you hiked, crossing back over the metal bridges and following the wide trail back to the pump house. At the gravel road, begin the long walk back to the metal gate where you started your hike."
Cheakamus Canyon Trail,4.7,Howe Sound,Easy,3.0,9.0,April - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/cheakamus-canyon/,"The Cheakamus Canyon is a scenic walk that begins from the end of Paradise Valley north of Squamish and ends at the Sea To Sky Highway. The route follows the Sea To Sky Trail and passes Starvation Lake along with multiple views of the canyon and Tantalus Mountain Range. The trailhead begins at the end of the dirt road near the river. If you parked in the 2-wheel drive parking further back, walk along the road and continue on the trail. Note that there are occasional times of the year, particularly in the spring, where the beginning of the trail can be flooded due to the Cheakamus River overflowing its banks. Follow the trail as it quickly begins to ascend, zig-zagging its way uphill underneath the power lines. Pass by a red gate and continue follow the trail as it begins to climb more gradually as you quickly make time. The trail passes through a forested section before climbing up a hill of loose rock and reaching the train tracks. Jump down from the cement block and cross the train tracks, following the trail on the other side. The route briefly descends before ascending another hill and reaching Starvation Lake. The lake is beautiful in the summer and there are a few places on the far side that provide easy access to the lake. To hike there, continue past the lake and go right at a junction, following the lake around to the far end. After enjoying the lake, continue your hike as you follow the well defined path as it climbs steeply through a section of trail and opens up, offering views of the canyon below and Tantalus Mountain Range. As you continue your hike, watch for a worn path on the left and follow that short trail to a couple of viewpoints. To the left, there is a viewpoint just above the railway tracks, The path to the right goes towards a small hill where there is a rope to assist you up the steep, short hill where a view awaits from the top. Return to the main trail and continue your hike as the trail passes along a section of trail that has been reenforced by metal rods and cables that cling to the edge of the cliff, hanging just above the railway tracks. The route then climbs steadily as it wraps around the canyon before reaching an open section with more views of the canyon and surrounding mountains. Continue to follow the trail as it continues to hug the mountain side and then reaches another rocky viewpoint looking north. The trail continues into the forest before making a final, short ascent to the side of the Sea To Sky Highway. Continue along the highway to the large gravel clearing and walk out towards the rocks, climbing up onto them for some of the best views of the canyon. The Sea To Sky Trail continues alongside the highway from this point but this marks the end of the Cheakamus Canyon route. Return via the same route you arrived, following the trail downhill, back into the trees, and continue as it wraps around the hills. Pass Starvation Lake, cross the train tracks, and continue back downhill until you reach the riverside near where you began your hike."

Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. One of the easier hikes in Garibaldi Provincial Park, Cheakamus Lake offers beautiful views of a turquoise lake surrounded by towering mountains and lush forests. Walk towards the sign at the far end of the parking lot and take a look at the BC Parks map. Look past the sign for a view of the Cheakamus River far below. Start your walk along the trail as it gradually heads uphill and into the trees. Just over half an hour into your hike, you reach a sign that points the way to Helm Lake. For a short side trip, walk down this trail towards Cheakamus River and onto the bridge for a view of the rushing river below. After taking in the roaring sound of the river, walk back up towards the main trail and turn right to head towards Cheakamus Lake. As you near the lake after walking just 3km, the turquoise river appears to the right of the trail. Another short distance along the trail and you have reached the north end of the lake. Just beyond the first views of the lake is a camping area where campers can set up their tents along the shoreline. Continue walking along the lake for another 4km towards the Singing Creek campground at the other end of the lake. Here is a rocky area along the side of the lake that offers beautiful views of the lake and the surrounding scenery. After enjoying a lunch break in the beautiful lake surroundings, follow your footsteps back along the trail where you came from towards the parking lot where you started your walk earlier in the day."
Cheam Lake Wetlands,3.7,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,2.3,year-round,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/cheam-lake-wetlands/,"Cheam Lake Wetlands consists of 93 hectares of land which was turned into a park in 1990. The park is a popular area for birdwatching, picnics, short walks, and family outings and is set amongst the scenic backdrop of Mount Cheam, just east of Chilliwack, BC. The trails are divided into 3 sections and the longest two loops are only 1km each. The third trail is a short path that leads out to a viewpoint of the lake, passing over a couple of floating bridges. Each of the trails have very little elevation change and can be walked by all ages. For a view of the Lake, walk to the right side of the parking lot where the gravel trail begins near the picnic area. Follow the gravel trail for a few hundred meters as it passes over a couple of floating bridges and brings you up onto a raised wooden viewing platform. This view is the best vantage point of the area. The Creek Trail starts along the path to the viewpoint and follows a small stream through a forested area. The shade and the stream can make this route a cooler option during the hot mid-day temperatures of the summer. Cross over the wooden bridge and continue along side the stream until you meet a junction. You can choose to take either route as it will loop back around within a 100 meters or so and return you to this junction. After completing the loop, walk back down along the creek, cross the bridge, and follow the path until you return to the lake area. Starting with the Loop Trail on the left side of the parking lot, walk across the grassy area and find the start of the trail near the edge of the lake. The gravel trail splits between two marsh areas before heading into the forest and reaching a junction. Go left at the junction to do the loop in a clockwise direction and a short distance later, you come up a wooden walkway next to a beaver pond. The large pile of wood sticks is a beaver lodge and sightings are common in the summer during the evening hours. Continue following the trail as it winds around, through  the forest, over another wooden bridge, before passing along a straight stretch. Not much further and you reach the junction where you began the loop. Go left and return to the picnic and parking lot area."
Chilliwack Community Forest,2.7,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.5,3.0,February - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/chilliwack-community-forest/,"From the parking lot, follow the trail past the map board as it climbs gradually through some gentle switchbacks before reaching a junction. This description follows the trails in a clockwise direction, so at the junction, go left onto the Pi:txel Trail heading towards the Cholqthet Trail. The trail continues to climb as it enters the forest but the elevation gain is relatively gentle as it continues through several switchbacks. Cross over a wooden platform and just a bit further, go left at a junction onto the Cholqthet Trail. Continue following the route uphill as you enjoy the beautiful, lush forest. Eventually, you arrive at another junction with a sign to the Broken Tree Trail. Go left, and continue ascending to where the trail splits into two. Either way takes you to the same place, however going right follows a steeper, shorter route and going left is a much more gradual route. Go right up the steep route as it's less popular with the mountain bikers and make your way to the top of the Broken Tree Trail. At the top of the Broken Tree Trail loop, you can go left for a very short distance to see where the junction is for the trail to the Gloria Lookout, a challenging 5.5km trail to an incredible view of the Fraser Valley. Instead, go right and leave the Broken Tree Trail as you begin to follow the Upper Canyon Trail through a relatively flat section, continuing your hike in a clockwise direction. When the trail reaches a junction, continue straight following along the canyon ridge high above the creek as the trail begins to descend quickly and through small switchbacks. When the trail reaches a junction with the Canyon Loop Trail, decide whether to take the shorter route to the right (about 500m) or the longer route to the left (about 1.7km). This description goes right, following the shorter route as you make your way through the forest to another junction with a kid's trail. Go straight until you reach a 3-way junction, which is where the long route for the Canyon Loop Trail rejoins the trail. Continue to following the wide, well defined route until you are back at the first junction where you began your hike. Go left and walk back down the gravel switchbacks, returning to the parking lot area."
Chris Hatfield Trail,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,1.0,2.8,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/chris-hatfield-trail/,"The Chris Hatfield Trail is located on Salt Spring Island and goes to Yeo Point in Ruckle Provincial Park, offering incredible coastal views looking towards Pender Island and Prevost Island. The route descends gradually along a forest trail down towards the coast, where there is access to a rocky beach and several nearby viewpoints. The trail begins near the cul-de-sac on Meyer Road, however do not walk down any of the driveways belonging to the local property owners. The trailhead is located between two driveways with a sign marking the start of the Chris Hatfield Trail. It is also worth noting that this is a much shorter route to Yeo Point than beginning from Beaver Point Provincial Park or Ruckle Provincial Park. Follow the trail as you begin to descend along a trail that passes in-between the fences of private property. The trail will begin to descend at a steeper pace as you walk through the beautiful, lush forest. At a junction, go straight and then go straight at a second junction, staying on a narrower hiking-type trail. The trail goes down a semi-steep section and eventually reaches a dirt road crossing. Cross the road and continue along the trail on the other side as the route abruptly swerves to the right, before going left again and crossing a small wooden bridge over a creek. The trail continues through the forest until it reaches a park sign along the coastal trail with directions to several points of interest. From the sign, it's just a short work down to a rocky beach area. If you go left, you can walk about 5 minutes to Yeo Point where some of the best views can be seen on a clear day. The views will look out towards Pender and Prevost Island and you will often see ferries passing by as several routes use the waterways off of this area of Salt Spring Island. After enjoying the area, you can return to the park sign, just up from the beach, and begin walking up the trail, passing through the forest. Cross the wooden bridge and go straight at the junctions as you continue uphill, eventually returning to the trailhead where you began."
Cliff Gilker Park,5.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,1.0,2.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/cliff-gilker-park/,"Cliff Gilker is located in Roberts Creek on the Sunshine Coast and has a network of easy hiking trails that pass several scenic waterfalls. The park offers a perfect hike for families to explore the bridges, forest, and terrain along several picturesque creeks. There are a mix of trails in the park that are colour coded by Yellow, Green, Red, and Blue trails. You can pick your own route along multiple trails to explore as the trails and junctions are very well marked. The description below follows the Yellow trails along Clack Creek and then branches off onto the Green Trail before looping back along the south eastern portion of the Red trail. From the gravel parking lot near the soccer field, walk towards the building at the end of the parking lot and follow a trail behind the building into the forest. Go right and follow the Yellow Trail downhill, watching for views of Clack Creek, the spectacular waterfall, and the bridges that cross the creek. Stay on this side of the creek and follow the Yellow trail to the bottom of the trail as you enjoy the scenic views. At the bottom of the Yellow trail, cross the bridge and then go right, following the southern part of the Red trail. At a second junction, go left and continue to follow the Red trail as it begins to climb uphill, making its way through the lush forest. The uphill section continues for quite sometime but is relatively gentle as you cross the occasional small, wooden bridge. When you reach the junction with the Green trail, you can continue on the Red trail for a longer hike, or, go left and follow the Green trail. The trail is relatively flat through this section and can be quite muddy after rainfalls. Eventually, the Green trail arrives at a junction with the Red trail. Go left and walk a short distance to the Yellow trail. Cross over a wooden platform above the waterfall area and you return to the area near where you began your hike behind the building near the parking lot. At any point, you can extend your hike and explore all of the bridge crossings along the Yellow trail. All of them are very scenic and offer unique views of several waterfalls."
Coliseum Mountain,3.4,The North Shore,Difficult,10.0,23.5,July - September,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/coliseum-mountain/,"Coliseum Mountain and all other backcountry trails in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park are nowclosedfor the season. The trail will re-open in roughly July 2025, or when the snow and conditions allow. The hike to Coliseum Mountain is a strenuous and challenging trail due to the overall distance, the elevation gain, and the rugged terrain. However, those who reach the summit are rewarded with spectacular panoramic views of the region. This trail is only recommended for experienced hikers with a good level of all around fitness. From the parking lot, walk across the Lynn Creek Bridge to the large signboard and map on the other side and sign in at the registration board. Head to your left along the Lower Lynn Loop Trail which runs parallel with Lynn Creek to the left. This portion of the trail consists of a wide gravel road with little elevation gain. Continue forward past a junction as the trail merges into the Cedars Mill Trail. This section becomes narrower but is still easy to navigate as you cross some small bridges and pass through small groves of trees. About 4km in, you will enter a clearing known as the Third Debris Chute where a signpost points the way to the right towards Norvan Falls. Follow the path up the rocky clearing to another signpost nearby and go left at this junction to continue along the Lynn Headwaters Trail toward Norvan Falls. You will encounter larger rocks and some tree roots along this section of trail as it heads through the forest. About 3km further you will reach another signpost that marks the junction to go to Coliseum Mountain. First, ensure you have budgeted more than enough daylight hours from this point to complete the entire roundtrip hike back to the parking lot before continuing on the path to your right. If you choose to proceed you will see a large sign nailed to a tree pointing the way up to the Coliseum Mountain route and a cautionary notice. Please read the notice and only continue further if you are adequately prepared as the trail is dangerous from this point forward. Immediately, the trail drastically increases in difficulty. The trail is marked well with orange ribbons and yellow tree tags so keep an eye out for them as you can easily stray off the path if you lose sight of the markers. The elevation gain is greatly increased, the terrain becomes very rugged and presents an obstacle course of large rocks, exposed tree roots, uneven and unstable surfaces, and some fallen trees intersecting the trail. The vast majority of the trail is tough and climbs steeply until it levels out briefly where you encounter a muddy section with a path of tree stumps for crossing through. Some of the stumps are loose and slippery so secure your footing as you cross over. Soon, the trail becomes very difficult again with the combination of steep elevation gain, jagged rocks, loose dirt, and exposed tree roots that pose a tripping hazard. Eventually you will come across a small pond. This is a good spot to take a break before the final ascent. The trail remains rocky and steep to the peak and you can catch glimpses of the surrounding mountains and East Vancouver on a clear day. Soon, the trees begin to thin out and you will be scrambling up the face of the mountain. Keep an eye out for orange ribbons pinned by rocks and tied to small branches that mark the trail leading to the summit. Once you reach the summit enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, Cornett Lakes, and Hanes Valley.  If you choose to continue further to the nearby lake at the top of Coliseum Mountain do so with care as there is no marked trail to the lake. On your return trip be sure to leave ample time to safely complete the trip within daylight hours and be sure to follow the trail markers. The hike back presents the major challenge of descending through steep and rugged terrain where you will need to ensure at least three points of contact through many sections in order to safely navigate the trail to avoid falling. Secure your footing, use your hands wherever necessary, and steady your balance to help prevent injuring yourself or others ahead of you. When you reach the junction for the Lynn Headwaters Trail head left back along the route you came from toward the Cedars Mill Trail and Lynn Loop Trail. When you reach the signboard at the Lynn Loop trailhead, don't forget to deposit the other half of your registration sheet before heading back to the parking lot."
Colony Farm Regional Park,3.5,Vancouver City,Easy,1.5,8.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/colony-farm-regional-park/,"Located in Port Coquitlam just off of Lougheed Highway, Colony Farm Regional Park has a number of trails that pass along the Coquitlam River and offer views of the nearby fields. The area is popular with joggers, cyclists, bird watchers and those going for a quick walk who want to enjoy some scenery along the Coquitlam River. The popular Traboulay PoCo Trail passes right through a section of the park. There are several trail options in the park and it's recommended to check the map before you leave the parking area to plan your route. This description will explain a route that crosses the Millennium Bridge, then follows the Wilson Farm Dyke Trail before returning via the same route. However, you can choose to explore your own route through the park. From the map near the parking lot, follow the trail past the community gardens, then go left along the Garden Trail. Immediately, there are scenic views looking across the fields towards the Coquitlam Mountains in the distance. After walking about 900-meters, cross the small bridge and walk up the stairs to the wide trail on the dyke. Go right and walk along the wide path to the big bridge, called the Millennium Bridge. Cross over it and enjoy the view of the slowly moving Coquitlam River below. On the other side, go left and follow the wide trail along the Wilson Farm Dyke Trail as you catch some scenic views of the river to your left and mountains in the distance. A short distance later, there is a bench with a view looking across the wildlife habitat area. Depending on the time of year, many birds can often be spotted and the occasional larger animal, such as a coyote. Continue following the trail to a junction with the Pumphouse Trail but go left and stay on the Wilson Farm Dyke Trail. This section of trail is park of the Traboulay PoCo Trail, which is a long route around Port Coquitlam that is a popular biking route. The path reaches a junction, where the Traboulay PoCo Trail goes off to the left. Staying in Colony Farm Regional Park, go right and walk along the trail until it reaches a metal gate. The metal gate marks the end of the park and, at this point, you can turn back and retrace your footsteps. Walk back to the Millennium Bridge, crossing over it, then going right and down the small set of stairs across the small bridge, following the Garden Trail back to the parking lot."
Conflict Lake,3.8,Whistler,Intermediate,5.0,12.0,June - September,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/conflict-lake/,"Conflict Lake is located in the Callaghan Valley to the west of Whistler and offers a beautiful hike  through forests and scenic meadow areas. The Callaghan Valley is a popular cross-country skiing area in the winter and the trail to Conflict Lake passes the nearby Journeyman Lodge. The trail starts about 200-meters before Callaghan Lake, on the left side of the gravel road. Follow the trail as it heads into the forest and immediately crosses a bridge of wooden logs over the rushing water. The well-worn trail continues through the forest, crossing several narrow boards that pass over small streams or muddy sections. Watch your step along these crossings as they can often be slippery early in the day. After walking for about 1.8km, you reach a junction with a sign on a tree. Go right in the direction pointing towards the Lodge and follow the trail as it immediately climbs uphill. The next section is the most difficult part of the trail as it ascends and passes over rocks and logs. The trail eventually reaches an open meadow and crosses a small creek. A few steps further and you can begin to catch glimpses of Powder Mountain to the left and up ahead. The trail has very little incline through this section but can often be muddy and slippery. After making your way along the trail and looking at the beautiful scenery, the Journeyman Lodge suddenly appears up ahead. Follow the trail as it goes straight towards the front door of the lodge, then go right, walking along the side of the building to where the trail continues down a hill towards Conflict Lake. Conflict Lake is just a short walk from the Callaghan Lodge and there are a few places around the lake that offer a beautiful area to sit and take in the scenery. The first view of the lake is to the right, just as you?re walking down the hill. A second option is to continue a bit further and look for a worn path that goes off to the right and follow it as it goes alongside the lake and ends next to the shoreline by several rocks to sit on. Another great viewpoint is to continue following the main path around to the northwest side of the lake, looking for a grassy clearing where you can walk right down to the shoreline and see across the lake. Hikers wishing to extend their hike can continue on towards Ring Lake, which is an additional 4-5km from Conflict Lake, making the complete round-trip 20km from the parking area to Ring Lake and back again. Note that the trail has minimal elevation gain until the final kilometer to Ring Lake, where it climbs steeply. After enjoying the scenery at Conflict Lake, return to the main trail and begin walking back towards the Lodge. Go left by the front door and down the trail as it passes the little ponds and rocks, offering views of Powder Mountain in the distance. Cross over the creek and follow the trail through the forest as it weaves its way through the trees, descending quickly and passing over the little streams. At the junction, go left and hike the final leg of your journey back towards the parking lot area, crossing over the log bridge near the end."
Cool Creek Canyon,4.8,Pemberton,Intermediate,2.0,3.5,April - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/cool-creek-canyon/,"The trailhead for Cool Creek Canyon has been moved to the the Spetch Creek FSR where there is an official sign and lots of parking. We will update the map shortly to show the full route. Total roundtrip distance is 3.5km. Cool Creek Canyon is a short, steep hike that offers scenic views of waterfalls and the Birkenhead River valley area north of Pemberton, BC. The route climbs up the steep hill on one side of Cool Creek, crossing a bridge higher up, before descending down the other side back to the road. From the trailhead next to the small gravel parking area alongside Portage Road, walk past the wooden sign and follow the trail as it begins to climb quickly. The route passes through a forested section, offering occasional glimpses of Cool Creek while steadily climbing as you work to pace yourself. Near a rockslide, the trail veers to the left and continues following a path near the creek. There are no trail markers but the route is clearly defined and well maintained. As you make your way higher up the canyon, there are a couple of places to enjoy the view of the rushing water. Do not venture too close as the rocks can be slippery and the rushing water can quickly sweep you over the edge unexpectedly. The trail weaves its way up onto several rocky ridges and scenic views of the Birkenhead River valley can be seen between the trees. Quickly stop to enjoy the views, catch your breath, before continuing up the narrow trail that pass up and over the rocks. The route begins to ascend at a lower rate as you quickly make time through the forest and reach a wooden bridge crossing Cool Creek. This is the highest elevation point of the hike and the trail will descend on the opposite side of the creek. Follow the trail downhill as it descends via a series of switchbacks where there is often a great view of a waterfall at the switchbacks closest to the creek. There are a couple of spots that offer a clearer view of the waterfalls than they did on the other side of the canyon. As you continue descending, the trail reaches a junction where another trail goes off a short distance to the right to a picnic table. This is a beautiful spot with a view that looks north up the Birkenhead River valley, offering a great place for lunch. Return to the trail and continue to descend. The hike down is fairly quick as you continue to follow the creek before the trail exits the forest and returns back to Portage Road. Walk left along side the highway back to the small gravel parking area to where you began your hike."
Coquitlam Crunch,3.7,Tri Cities,Intermediate,1.5,4.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/coquitlam-crunch/,"The Coquitlam Crunch is a steep, urban trail that follows a route under large hydro power lines and offers a great workout. With the trail's location directly under the power lines, all of the views are obstructed by these lines and giant towers. However, the Coquitlam Crunch is a shorter, less intense version of the Grouse Grind with the sole purpose of exercise. From the wooden signboard next to the gravel parking lot, walk up the gravel trail and just a short distance later, you arrive at a crosswalk on Lansdowne Drive. Cross the street and continue your hike uphill. This section is the steepest, most difficult part of the trail as the route climbs quickly without much of a break. The trail begins to level as you approach the next street crossing which, again, is Lansdowne Drive. After crossing the street, the trail climbs at a much gentler rate before making a right and heading up a few stairs. The next road to cross is David Avenue, where the trail changes from gravel to a paved pathway. Continue past the dog off-leash area and up to a junction. Go left at the junction and up a few stairs towards the basketball and tennis courts, staying on the right side of the courts and following the path up to the road. Walk left, along the side walk up to the 3-way stop and cross the street, heading up hill on the other side of the intersection. The final section of the Coquitlam Crunch climbs up a wide, paved path and passes a sport field on your right. Just beyond the field, the trail again turns into gravel as you complete the last portion up to Eagle Mountain Drive. The sense of accomplishment is brief though as you turn around and walk back down towards the parking area, following the same path but working a different set of muscles in your legs."
Coquitlam Lake View Trail,0.0,Tri Cities,Intermediate,5.0,11.0,May - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/coquitlam-lake-view-trail/,"The Coquitlam Lake View Trail climbs up along the trails of Burke Mountain in Pinecone Burke Provincial Park to a rocky bluff with a spectacular view of the Coquitlam Watershed area. The route passes through a network of trails and deactivated logging roads before it climbs up a short steep trail just before the viewpoint. From the metal gate at Harper Road, walk up the gravel road and past the wooden map board. Follow the gravel road until it reaches another gravel road to the left. Go left on this gravel road and begin hiking uphill as it climbs at a fairly gently pace through the forest. You may notice several trails on both sides of the road that are used by mountain bikers. When the road reaches the powerlines, continue walking up hill on the rocky section where a trail starts next to a wooden post. The trail marks the Coquitlam Lake View Trail and, on some posts or markers throughout the hike, maybe abbreviated to ""CLVT"". Walk up the narrow, rocky path and into the forest. The trail immediately widens again and you follow an old, deactivated logging road for most of the hike. The trail is rocky, so pick your course as you make your way uphill. There are a few creek crossings that should be easily passable throughout the year when there is no snow. Continue to stay on the wide trail as you pass several junctions that veer off to the left or right. Eventually, the trail reaches a rocky creek with a small waterfall that tumbles down the rocks to the right. Carefully cross the rocky creek bed and veer left as you follow the wide trail. Just a short distance further and you reach a sign on the right pointing uphill to the ""Coquitlam Lake View Trail"". Go right and follow the narrow hiking trail as it climbs steep through the second generation growth forest. You will pass several huge stumps giving an indication how large some of the trees were before the area was logged. The trail continues to climb until it reaches a junction with the South Ridge Trail. Go left and continue as you are back walking on a wide, old deactivated logging road again. This section of trail has very little elevation change as you pass through the area quite quickly. As you approach a junction, look for a sign on the right for a trail to the Coquitlam Lake Viewpoint. The old viewpoint used to be to the left and a short walk up, however the trees grew over the years and have blocked that view. The new viewpoint is to the right and a very steep, narrow trail to reach it. Follow the markers as you climb up the steep route and after five minutes or so, you will reach the rocky bluff with an incredible view. The view looks down onto the Coquitlam Watershed and across to the Eagle Mountain area. To the left, you can see a bit of Coquitlam and Port Moody in the distance. After enjoying the view, carefully hike back down the steep trail, watching where you place your feet, as you return quickly to the old deactivated road. Go left and walk down the hill, following the same route you arrived. Go right at the junction and back down through the forest where the trail meets with the road again and the creek crossing near the small waterfall. Continue following the long trail back downhill, being mindful of the loose rocks, until you reach the powerlines. Then, walk straight downhill along the gravel road, making a right at the bottom and returning to the metal gate where you began your hike on Harper Road."
Crater Rim Trail,4.7,Whistler,Intermediate,2.0,4.5,May - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/crater-rim-trail/,"The Crater Rim Trail is located in the Whistler Interpretive Forest and loops around Loggers Lake passing several scenic views and through a beautiful forest. Loggers Lake is situated in an extinct volcano and the Crater Rim Trail passes around the upper ridges that surround the lake. The trail begins next to the wooden signboard next to the gravel road and across from a small parking area. If you are unable to get parked at this tiny parking lot, you can park back down the road near where you crossed the one-way bridge in a designated parking area, then walk up the Riverside Trail along the west side of the Cheakamus River. This adds additional distance and time to your hike but the Riverside Trail is scenic, passes a suspension bridge, and is a relatively easy walk. From the start of the trail, follow the rocky trail uphill towards Loggers Lake as it quickly gains elevation. Along the way, there are several views that look back down towards the valley. As the trail levels, watch for a small trail with a blue sign on the left marked Crater Rim Trail and go left, following this trail uphill. The sign says that the Crater Rim Trail is 6km but we found that to be a bit generous and that the trail was closer to 4.5km to complete the loop, returning to the small parking lot. Follow the trail as it heads uphill into the forest and is marked with yellow diamond markers on the trees. Within minutes, you reach a clearing where you look down onto Loggers Lake for one of the most scenic views of the area. Loggers Lake is known to be one of the warmest lakes in Whistler as the rocky walls of the volcano that surround the lake protect it from the cooler air and the lake is not glacier fed like many other lakes in the region. Continue following the trail as it climbs further before levelling and following a narrow path high above the vegetation below. The trail then veers right and follows along a ridge, where there both sides of the trail have drop-offs. At the first junction, continue going straight but look for the occasional openings on the left side of the trail to enjoy scenic mountain views looking southeast towards Garibaldi Provincial Park. Upon reaching another junction that has no parkings on the wooden pole, go straight and continue up the hill where there is another junction a short distance further. At this junction that's well marked with a blue sign, go right onto the Crater Rim Trail and continue uphill as the trail veers right and climbs to the highest point. There is a viewpoint not much further where Loggers Lake can be seen far below. A few more minutes of climbing and the trail leaves and passes through a second generation forest. The trail is fairly flat with small inclines and declines for quite some distance, as you quickly move through this section of the route. Eventually, you reach another viewpoint that looks northeast over the valley towards the Sea To Sky Highway in the distance. After this point, the trail descends steeply through a series of switchbacks. Carefully make your way down the hill as the loose rocks can be slippery on several sections. When the trail reaches a junction next to an outhouse, go left and following the wide trail around Loggers Lake, back towards where you began. Watch for a small trail on the right side that leads to Loggers Lake and follow this route down to the water. There is a path next to the lake that leads to a makeshift wooden dock. After hiking the Crater Rim Trail on a hot summer's day, the lake is a perfect place to take a swim to cool down before heading back to the parking lot. After enjoying Loggers Lake, return to the main trail and go right heading back past the junction that you passes at the start of the hiker earlier. Following the wide trail back down the rocky hill and return to the parking area. If you had to park further down the Cheakamus River, pass through the parking lot and return via the Riverside Trail."
Crooked Falls,4.2,Howe Sound,Intermediate,3.5,6.0,April - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/crooked-falls/,"Crooked Falls is a spectacular waterfall that tumbles over several rocks and has stunning views looking directly at the waterfall and at its side. Located in the Upper Squamish Valley just off of the Sigurd Trail, the hike to the waterfall also has several scenic viewpoints looking down towards the Squamish River and across the valley. From the trailhead on Ashlu Road, follow the Sigurd Trail up the rocky route as it climbs quickly at the beginning. The steep climb up the rocky trail is short as the route veers to the left and follows an old logging road. As the logging road levels out, look for a dirt pathway marked with the Sigurd Trail sign and follow this trail to the left as it continues along a fairly flat, narrower trail. There is a stunning viewpoint of the Squamish Valley on the left but it's easy to miss because it's on a rocky bluff and there are no markers except a slightly worn trail. Watch for that worn trail on your left and follow it out onto the rocky bluff, where you get a clear view looking down the valley towards Howe Sound as well as the mountainss to the east. Returning to the trail, continue to follow it until it veers right and begins to climb steeply. Watch your step as you make your way up the steep section before the trail arrives at a clearing on another rock bluff with a viewpoint of the valley. This viewpoint is not as good as the first, so if you missed the first one, try to look for it on the way back. Continue hiking past the viewpoint and back into the forest as the trail gradually climbs and passes a huge boulder. Not much further and the trail begins to climb steeply again. Follow the route through the switchbacks and continue uphill as this section is where you will gain the bulk of the elevation to Crooked Falls. Eventually, the trail reaches a junction with a yellow sign pointing left to Crooked Falls. Go left and follow the trail as it slightly descends through the next 300-metres until it reaches the waterfall. There are two great views of the waterfall, first follow the trail down the hill to a spot in front of the falls to watch the full force of the water cascading over the rocks from above. After enjoying this spot, there is another view to the side of the waterfall. Hike back up the trail to where a worn path goes down to the side of the falls but use extreme caution as this route is very slippery. After enjoying the waterfall, return along the same route, going right at the junction and beginning the hike back down the hill. Pass the boulder and the viewpoints and follow the old logging road through the forest before it makes its final decent back down the rocky section to Ashlu Road."
Crown Mountain,4.7,The North Shore,Difficult,7.0,9.8,July - October,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/crown-mountain/,"Crown Mountain and all other backcountry trails in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park are nowclosedfor the season. The trail will re-open in roughly July 2025, or when the snow and conditions allow. The hike to Crown Mountain behind Grouse Mountain is very difficult but on a clear day, you will be rewarded with incredible views of the Capilano Watershed, the Lions, the city of Vancouver in the distance, and many backcountry coastal mountains. The jagged peak, which resembles a crown, towers above several of the other nearby mountains. What makes this trail so difficult is you have to hike down a very steep trail into Crown Pass before hiking up the steep side of Crown Mountain, then return the same route. The elevation change is therefore misleading compared to other hikes as you have to essentially hike the elevation change twice. The trail to Crown Mountain is located in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park and is best accessed via the Alpine Trail behind Grouse Mountain by taking the Grouse Mountain Skyride to the top. Ambitious hikers can also take the Grouse Grind, BCMC Trail, or Hanes Valley route but adding these routes onto the Crown Mountain trail will make for a very long, gruelling day. From the Grouse Mountain Chalet, walk towards the Peak ski run and the area where the Grizzly Bear enclosure is located. Pass the Grizzly Bears on your left and continue onto the gravel towards the ski run. Just to the left of the ski run is a gravel road that takes you into the backcountry behind Grouse. Follow this road as it passes along the mountain and offers a few interesting views. The wide gravel road abruptly ends and a very rocky trail heads uphill. Follow this trail as it narrows but continues climbing quickly as you pass under, then over a couple of pipes. You want to follow the signs to the Alpine Trail but the signage in this area can be a bit confusing as the Alpine Trail is not mentioned on all signs. Pass the first sign (which only mentions the Ridge Trail and does not mention the Alpine Trail) and continue uphill until you reach a junction with a second sign. Go right at the second sign and follow the Alpine Trail until it reaches a zipline platform. If you reach the zipline, you are on the right trail. Continue along the Alpine Trail by going left as you begin hiking into the backcountry and away from all of the tourists at Grouse Mountain. The Alpine Trail continues gaining elevation as the well marked trail passes several junctions, include those to Thunderbird Ridge, Dam Mountain, and 2 junctions to Little Goat Mountain. The trail descends slightly to a sign that points to Crown Mountain to the left. Go left onto the Crown Mountain Trail and you immediately emerge from the trees onto a rocky outcrop with a direct view of your destination. Begin the difficult part of the hike by walking down the trail towards Crown Pass. The next 1km will be the first real test as it descends very steeply, over slippery rocks and through a series of sections that have chains to help you. Be careful as the trail is often muddy and slippery due to being hidden from direct sunlight. Eventually, the trail opens from the forest as you cross a small boulder field. A short distance later and you reach the junction at the bottom of Crown Pass with the Hanes Valley Trail. Continue hiking past the Hanes Valley Junction as the trail immediately begins to climb steeply over large rooted trees and big rocks used as steps. The next 1.9km to the top is difficult, offering little rest. When you reach a boulder field, look for the yellow spray painted markings on the rocks and follow those across the field where the trail enters the forest on the other side. The trail continues climbing before a brief drop into a dried creek bed, then back to the uphill slog. Passing through the second boulder field offers the first views that look down towards the Capilano Watershed area. Continue along the trail as you climb up some rocks and the trail eventually reaches a big spray painted dot on the side of the rock. This rock is the final portion to the very peak but it's a bit challenging to climb onto because there is no easy crevice to grab onto. You can either climb up onto the peak by the big dot or follow a small trail to the left and climb up onto the rock around the side. Be very careful on or around the peak as it's a long way down on all sides and slipping and falling will mean serious injury and possibly death. On a clear sunny day, the views from Crown Mountain are nothing short of spectacular. You can see the city of Vancouver in the distance, down into the Hanes Valley, down towards the Capilano watershed, over to the mountains near Cypress, the Lions, and well into the backcountry, including mountains as far north as Squamish. Make sure to leave yourself plenty of time to return to Grouse Mountain as the trail is just as difficult returning. Carefully hike back down the steep rocks and descend back towards Crown Pass. Pass the junction with Hanes Valley and begin climbing out of Crown Pass. Often at the end of the day, you will encounter tired hikers who have made their way up the steep Hanes Valley route. Just before the Alpine Trail on the rocky outcrop, take the opportunity to look back at Crown Mountain to see where you had been and marvel in the hard work it took to reach its peak. Return to Grouse Mountain by going right on the Alpine Trail and staying on the trail as you pass the other junctions. At the zipline platform, go right and follow the trail downhill until it meets with the access road. Walk back down the road towards the grizzly bear enclosure before returning to the Grouse Mountain Skyride."
Crystal Falls,4.4,Tri Cities,Easy,2.0,7.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/crystal-falls/,"The Crystal Falls trail is closedThe trail crosses private property and tresspassing is illegal. Located east of Vancouver in Coquitlam, Crystal Falls is a scenic waterfall that drains into the Coquitlam River and is along a short, easy hike trail. The area is also popular with dog walkers and mountain bikers and the route can be very muddy for several months of the year, including small small streams that you have to step through or carefully cross trying not to get your shoes wet. From the unmarked trailhead on Karley Crescent, walk into the forest, down the short slope, and along the path as it runs parallel to the Upper Coquitlam River. The trail dips down to the edge of the river before climbing back uphill and continue northward to the falls. Continue walking as the route weaves its way along the shore and through the scenic, moss covered forest. After about 40 minutes, there is an old blue pickup truck abandoned on your left. From here, it's about another 15 minutes up the trail, crossing several more small streams, and finally arriving at a larger creek where Crystal Falls sits just a few meters further upstream. The area can be quite busy during the warmer weather months, so choose a place to sit and enjoy a snack while taking in the sights and sounds of the waterfall. Once you're ready to head back, walk down the trail, crossing the small streams, past the old pickup truck, and eventually out to the neighbourhood where you started your hike."
Cypress Falls,3.6,The North Shore,Easy,1.5,3.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/cypress-falls/,"Cypress Falls is the perfect hike to do during the winter months when other trails at higher elevations are buried under snow. Just a short walk takes you through a dense forest full of old Cedar and Douglas Fir trees while following Cypress Creek up past two beautiful waterfalls. From the parking lot, walk past the outhouse and towards the trail that heads into the forest. Go left and walk towards the sound of rushing water as the trail gradually makes its way uphill. A few steps from the parking lot, you arrive at the first junction. Continue to your left, as later, we will return along the other trail on the way back. The hiking trail winds through forests of Douglas Fir and Western Red Cedar trees covered in moss from the moist environment. Just a little further along the trail and at the bottom of a short hill is a viewpoint of the lower Cypress Falls from a rocky viewing area. Stop to take in the rushing water as it flows over the edge and drops into the canyon below. Continue along the trail towards the wooden bridge up ahead. Later we will cross the bridge but first continue up the steep section of the trail as it follows alongside the creek towards the upper falls. Fallen trees and stumps alongside the trail play an important role in replenishing the forest as new growth can be seen sprouting from the dead wood. Continue up the steep hill until you reach a chain-link fence with a large warning sign on it. This is the border of Cypress Falls Park and beyond this point belongs to a development company, which allows hikers to use their land. Continue past the fence and uphill, as it's only a short distance to the upper falls. As the sound of rushing water grows louder, watch for the waterfall up ahead to your right. From the viewing area, the upper falls can be seen dropping into the canyon below. Do not venture too close to the edge of the cliff as the loose dirt may be unstable and could give way from the weight of someone walking on it. Once you have taken in the upper falls, head back down the hill, passing through the fence, and eventually arriving back at the wooden bridge. This time, cross the wooden bridge and walk up the short, steep path on the other side. As the trail levels out, you will find yourself in the middle of a grove of large Cedar and Fir trees, some of which are 200 to 300 years old. Most areas of the North Shore have been logged in the last 100 years, so seeing and comparing old growth trees with second generation growth can be breathtaking. After enjoying the trees, walk back downhill towards the wooden bridge and after crossing it, go left past the viewing area of the lower falls where you stopped earlier. Walk up the short hill and just as you reach the top, a small trail appears on the left side. Follow this trail as it takes you to a second viewing area with a wooden railing and an alternate vantage point of the lower falls. After enjoying the view, continue along the path with the wooden railing as it weaves along the side of a steep cliff and eventually meets back with the main trail. At the intersection, go left and in a couple of minutes, you arrive back at the parking lot where you began your hike."
Dam Mountain,3.5,The North Shore,Easy,2.0,5.0,July - September,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/dam-mountain/,"Dam Mountain and all other backcountry trails in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park are nowclosedfor the season. The trail will re-open in roughly July 2025, or when the snow and conditions allow. Dam Mountain is located behind Grouse Mountain and is a short hike into the backcountry, offering views of the surrounding mountains and occasional glimpses of Vancouver and Burrard Inlet. The route is also a popular snowshoeing trail in the winter which is often referred to as the Snowshoe Grind. The sections of the Ridge and Alpine Trails connect to other backcountry trails allowing for longer hiking day-trips. The trail starts at the Grouse Mountain Skyride and is accessible by either taking the gondola up or hiking up theGrouse GrindorBCMC Trails. Walk towards the grizzly bear enclosure and continue past it towards the gravel road to the left of the Peak ski run. Follow this gravel road as it wraps around the mountain, offering occasional glimpses of Howe Sound and the Cypress Mountain area in the distance. The road abruptly ends and the trail continues up a hill of loose gravel. The route quickly narrows into a typical hiking trail as you reach a sign marking a junction. At the sign, go left following the Ridge Trail as it climbs steeply towards Dam Mountain. If you decide to do the loop, as suggested, you will return from the other direction via the Alpine Trail. The trail continues to climb fairly steeply, although not as quickly as the Grouse Grind does. Soon, you pass a wooden helicopter pad and the trail continues through the clearing and back into the trees. The trail then arrives at a sign and a final few steps up onto the rocky outcrop marks the top of Dam Mountain. There are some views between the trees of Burrard Inlet and the mountain ranges in behind Dam Mountain, however a lot of the view is obscured by trees. Look for trail markers on the opposite side you climbed up and continue along the Ridge Trail as it descends quickly, offering several scenic views of Crown Mountain. A short distance further and the trail reaches a junction with the Alpine Trail. If you're looking for a longer hike, you can go left and continue to eitherGoat Mountainor Crown Mountain. However, we will go right and return to Grouse Mountain via the Alpine Trail. Another potential side trip occurs at the junction on the Alpine Trail toThunderbird Ridge. The extra route takes about 45 minutes to an hour extra, depending on your pace, but offers scenic views of Kennedy Lake and the windmill at Grouse Mountain. Return to Grouse Mountain along the Alpine Trail as it follows a gradually descending route, eventually reaching a zipline platform. Go right at the zipline and down the hill to the junction with the Ridge Trail, walking under the pipe. Go left and follow the trail as it widens onto loose gravel and then arrives back at the gravel road. An easy walk along the road and past all the tourist attractions at Grouse Mountain brings you back to the gondola."
Davis Lake and McDonald Falls,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,1.0,1.1,April - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/davis-lake-mcdonald-falls/,"Davis Lake Provincial Park is located north of Mission, BC, and is a picturesque lake with some great views. The rugged and steep trail passes McDonald Falls, which has several points where the waterfall drops along Murdo Creek. Although the distance is short, the upper section of this trail is very steep, the terrain is rugged, with rocks to step over and a fallen tree to pass underneath. Some hikers will find this trail easy due to its short distance, but other will find it quite difficult due to the terrain.  The trail is well marked with plenty of orange trail markers on the trees. Follow the trail near the bridge, just off the Lost Creek Forest Service Road, as it gradually goes downhill towards Murdo Creek. Before reaching the creek, the trail veers sharply to the right and continues downhill. The upper section of the route is very steep, so use caution with your footing. The trail follows alongside Murdo Creek and there are some views of the waterfall. At a point where the trail is next to the creek, carefully step down onto the rocks below and enjoy the view of McDonald Falls. The best view from the trail is obstructed, so climbing down onto the rocks will offer the best view of the waterfall. Continue hiking down the trail as it descends at a gentler pace compared to the top section. Follow the trail markers on the trees and walk along the rocky route until you reach the beach next to Davis Lake. The view is spectacular with Monastic Peak to the left and clear, calm view across the lake. There is a trail along the east side of the lake the offers a few additional views of the lake. Once you've explored the area around Davis Lake, return via the route where you arrived and follow the orange markers back up the trail. The trail climbs steeply until making the last push up to the parking area long the Lost Creek Forest Service Road."
De Pencier Bluffs,5.0,The North Shore,Intermediate,3.0,4.8,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/de-pencier-bluffs/,"The hike to De Pencier Bluffs on Mount Seymour is a bit more difficult to find then some of the other popular trails, however there are scenic views of the nearby peaks and as far down to Indian Arm. The route passes Mystery Lake and is done as a loop. From the wooden map board at the end of the Mount Seymour parking lot, walk down the short hill and look for a sign on the right pointing to Mystery Lake. Follow the trail as it passes under the chairlift, then begins to head uphill. The trail climbs at a moderate pace as you continue to make your way through the low foliage along the well defined trail. The trail goes up a hill, then passes a small pond on the right as you walk along a series of boardwalks. Continue hiking as the route begins to climb again before crossing an open ski run, offering a view in the distance. After crossing this opening, the trail heads back into the forest and climbs steeply. As the route begins to level and you step onto some large rocks, you approach Mystery Lake. In the summer, this is a popular short hike offering an opportunity to swim and cool off in the lake. Continue hiking by following the trail along the right side of the lake. The trail does not appear obvious at first but it goes up a steep rock where you can see an orange trail marker on the tree up high. Go right at a junction (left takes you to another view of Mystery Lake) and follow the trail as it leaves Mystery Lake. The trail passes through an open, grassy area before descending down a hill. Near the bottom of this short hill, watch for a trail on the right. The trail is not marked with a sign but the path can be seen. Follow this trail as it descends down a steep hill, carefully picking your route and watching you step. The trail crosses a small creek then continues. Watch for junction to the left and go left. There is no sign at the junction but there are a couple of signs on trees that say “De Pencier” but they are also easy to miss. Follow this trail uphill and, after a short distance, take a short path to the right to a rocky outcrop with a view. While the view is not too bad, it is obstructed by several trees. Return to the trail and continue to follow it as it drops down a hill before continuing to ascend again. Finding the trail that goes to De Pencier Bluffs is the tricky part. As the trail goes uphill, watch for a rock that is about 3 feet high on your right. The rock has a indent in it that acts like a step, and the trail onto of the rock is clearly visible if you are looking for it. If you reach a clearing with a stream and cliff wall on your right, you have gone too far. Use the “step” to get onto the trail on top of the rock and follow the trail. There is a view to the right a short distance along the route. Go left as the trail climbs uphill and up a steep rocky section. At the top of the rocky section, the well defined route continues and veers right to go to the top of the Bluffs. Before going to the top, continue straight past where the trail veers right for an incredible view looking towards Mount Seymour and down towards small viewable sections of Indian Arm. This is probably the best viewpoint but be careful as sections to the left are a sheer cliff. Walk to the top of De Pencier Bluffs to see some of the views, including one looking down towards the parking lot and across to the mountains in the Belcarra region. Once you’ve enjoyed all of the views, follow the trail back down, carefully walking down the steep rocky section. Veer to the right and returns to the trail by the rock with the step at the junction. Instead of going back the route that you arrived, go right to begin a loop back to the parking lot. Follow the trail as it passes through a beautiful meadows with a stream and a rock cliff wall on the right. The trail crosses the stream before heading out of the meadow area. Make sure to follow a well defined trail as there are some other paths from people taking wrong routes but the actual trail is pretty obvious. The path heads uphill before passing a pond on the left and continuing to a ski run where a chairlift hangs overhead. Walk down the hill to the ski run, then go right and walk up the short hill before it veers to the left. Follow a ski run downhill for about 10-15-minutes until you reach a trail sign on the right. While it’s possible to follow the ski hill back down, it’s better to follow proper hiking trails. Go right and walk along the path before going left and following the rocky route back downhill, carefully watching your step. The trail will pass two junctions to Dinkey Peak and also pass the memorial to Tim Jones, the North Shore Rescue Manager who sadly passed away in 2014. Continue hiking downhill until you reach the bottom of the hill and arrive back at the parking lot."
Deas Island Regional Park,3.6,Tsawwassen and Delta,Easy,2.0,4.5,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/deas-island-regional-park/,"Located south of Vancouver, the trails around Deas Island Regional Park offer scenic views of the Fraser River area. Named after the settler John Sullivan Deas, the island was once the primary operation of a cannery that produced the largest amounts of salmon along the Fraser River. From any of the designated parking areas, start your walk on the north side of the island and go left on the Tinmaker's Walk Trail heading downriver. The first section offers the occasional view of the river between the bushes. Continue to the first junction and go right onto the Riverside Walk Trail as it approaches a clearing with better views of the river. The trail continues and joins with the Island Top Trail, crossing over the busy highway that leads into the George Massey Tunnel under the Fraser River. Shortly, you will arrive at a junction. This is the start of the island loop so whichever direction you go, you will return from the opposite direction. Go right and a short distance later, you arrive at a beach area. During low tide, you can walk along the sand to the western tip of the island. Walk back to the beach area and continue along the trail. Another short path leads out to the south side of the island to a muddy area with a view of the marina and the Ladner Marsh to the west. Return to the trail and walk back towards the Island Tip Loop junction and back over the entrance to the tunnel. At the junction, go right and another right again onto the Sand Dune Trail. This short, sandy route joins with the Dyke Loop Trail. Go right and walk along the raised gravel path to a trail that leads to a viewpoint of Deas Slough on the right. Back on the trail, continue as the path joins with the Slough View Trail. Eventually, the trail arrives at a junction with the Tidal Pond Trail. Go left, ignoring the Tidal Pond Trail and walk towards the parking area. Cross the road and walk towards the wooden viewing platform where, at the top, a scenic 180 degree view of the Fraser River can be seen. If you parked in the nearby parking lot, you have completed the island loop. If you parked at the parking lot further in near the picnic area, walk along the Tinmaker's Walk Trail to the junction and go left back to where you began."
Deer Lake,4.7,Vancouver City,Easy,1.0,5.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/deer-lake/,"Located in Burnaby just east of Vancouver, Deer Lake Park offers a nice, flat, and easy walk that circles the lake and passes by a beach area, a viewing tower, and pier, all offering great scenery. The trails are accessible all year and are popular with residents walking dogs or just out for an afternoon stroll through the park. There are several areas to start the walk around Deer Lake including at the Shadbolt Centre or just off of Royal Oak Street, however, we will begin from the beach area on the east side of the lake along Sperling Avenue. The beach can be quite busy on warm summer days with children playing on the playground. Go left and walk towards the small park building where the washrooms are located. On the other side of the building, cross the small bridge and follow the trail as it gradually climbs along the lake, away from the beach area. Go right at the paved road and follow the road as you pass by several houses located along the lake. Eventually, the pavement becomes gravel trail again as you walk towards the water and onto a wooden boardwalk. The old trail used to be very muddy through this section, however a new raised platform was built to make it easier on the feet as well as to protect the sensitive ecology. As the trail emerges from the wooden boardwalk, the area opens up with a view of the lake to the right and an open field in between. Continue where a short distance later you arrive at a junction that goes in several different directions. Off to the right is a map of the area, perfect for familiarizing yourself with Deer Lake Park. This field area was the former site of the infamous Oakalla Prison from 1912 to 1991. It is difficult to imagine that thousands of prisoners were incarcerated on this land and executions even took place at this location up until the 1960's. If you want to just do a short loop, follow the trail closest to the lake and walk along the wooden boardwalk to the north end of the park. However, we will complete the longer loop by continuing towards the viewing platform, which offers a view of the entire park area and is popular with bird watching enthusiasts. On a clear sunny day, the city and surrounding mountains are visible and offer a nice backdrop to the park. After enjoying the view, walk down the short gravel hill and head northwards, passing the remote-control airplane field and arriving at another junction. Go right at this junction and walk back towards the direction of the lake. When you reach the next junction you will note the boardwalk on the right. This path on the right comes from the same direction as the mapboard you looked at earlier and is the shorter route around the lake. Go left and stay on the gravel trail as you begin your walk around the north side of the lake. The trail veers to the left and arrives at another junction. Go right as you enter into a residential area and are suddenly walking on a paved street. There are plans to eventually build a bridge that would link the two shores together but for now you must walk on the road to the right and up about 40 meters to where a trail starts on the right. If you walk as far as where the road turns left, you have gone too far. Leaving the road behind and walking down the gravel trail, Deer Lake comes into view once again as the trail continues onto a wooden walkway along the lake shore. There are several view points along this section and a small pier to walk out on. If it is your first time exploring Deer Lake Park, there are several buildings along this side of the lake worth checking out including the Shadbolt Centre and Burnaby Art Museum just up the hill. If you are catching a bus, there are bus stops on the opposite side of the Shadbolt Centre. If you are returning to the beach area, continue along the path as it heads out towards the road. Cross the small stream along the sidewalk and then veer right back onto the trail towards the lake, staying on the boardwalk until you return to the beach a short distance later."
Demon Ridge,4.0,Howe Sound,Difficult,8.0,16.0,July - September,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/demon-ridge/,"The hike to Demon Ridge provides some of the most spectacular views of the region, including the Mamquam area, Martin Peak, and down towards Watersprite Lake. The trail branches off from the Watersprite Lake Trail, just before the prow lookout (at KM 4.7).  Take the left fork at the sign marked ""Demon Ridge"" where it follows an old logging road and follow the road as it makes its way up the south side of Demon Ridge. The following trail description for Demon Ridge begins at the Watersprite Lake Trailhead. Please note that this is a high elevation route and the trail climbs steeply in sections. Snow can linger along the route well into the summer months. From the metal gate at the Skookum parking lot area, walk up the hill to the wooden Trail Kiosk map board and continue past it.   Follow the rocky route as it passes just above the Skookum Dam below, to the left.  Follow the trail into the forest on an old logging road, first crossing Demon Creek on a wooden bridge, then almost immediately cross a wooden boardwalk that spans muddy Demon Creek Swamp.   Five minutes later, cross a second bridge over Skullhead Creek (KM .9). After about 20-30 minutes of hiking, the trail veers left and descends along a narrower route into the forest. Watch your step as you follow the trail downhill briefly before it starts ascending quickly, following along a narrow band that passes between two bog areas. Continue until you reach a 3-way junction and take note of this junction as you will need to follow the same route back when you return later in the day. Go right at the junction and follow the wide trail as it gradually climbs before becoming fairly level.  Move quickly through this section as it's relatively flat and easy. Eventually, the trail will veer left and begin to climb up a rocky section as you quickly gain elevation. After hiking uphill for about 600-metres, make a turn to the right and, a bit further, you will begin to see views of the valley and nearby peaks. After enjoying one of several views, continue following the trail, and cross the small creek next to the waterfall. The trail continues ascending at a gradual pace until you reach the junction for the Demon Ridge Trail at KM 4.7, which is marked by a labeled a green aluminum ""Demon Ridge"" sign on a post. Before going left to Demon Ridge, you may wish to follow the Watersprite Trail just a few meters further to an incredible viewpoint known as the ""The Prow Lookout"".  This stunning view overlooks the entire valley, up towards the Elfin Lakes area in Garibaldi Provincial Park, and down towards Squamish. From the signpost and junction with the Watersprite Trail, follow an old logging road uphill to the left.  After the trail passes a switchback to the right, it levels out briefly before passing a switchback to the left and climbing again.  After passing some large boulders, the trail opens up with incredible views of the valley to your right. As you enjoy the impressive views to the right during your hike up the old Demon Ridge logging road, continue to the end of the road and watch for flagging. At the end of the logging road, continue to follow the flagging along a trail as the well marked route continues to the summit. After enjoying the views, follow the route back down the way that you came, making sure to follow the trail ribbons. Rejoin the old logging road, and soak in the views once again before descending back down, as you quickly make time before rejoining the Watersprite Lake Trail. Go right and follow the Watersprite Lake Trail as it descends gradually, before veering left and descending down the rocky section of trail. After walking along the fairly flat section and reaching the 3-way junction, make sure to go left to head back towards the parking lot. Follow the narrow trail down before ascending to the final section of the route. After the final creek crossings and crossing over the wooden boardwalks, the trail opens up above the dam as you walk the last section back down to the metal gate where you began. The Demon Ridge Trail is a new trail and route, so further improvements and changes are expected.  As the views from the Demon Ridge Trail rival the now popular Watersprite Lake Trail, this one is also poised to become a local favorite."
Derby Reach Regional Park,3.4,Surrey and Langley,Easy,2.5,8.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/derby-reach-regional-park/,"Derby Reach Regional Park is located in Langley and includes the scenic trails along the Edgewater Bar section and a forest loop along the Houston Trail in the Historic Area. The park offers a camping area located along the Fraser River, a dog off-leash area, and easy walking trails that are popular year-round. You can start your hike from either the Edgewater Bar area or the Historic Area, however we will describe the route from the Edgewater Bar camping area and back. The trail starts across from campsite #1 as you enter the forest along the Edge Trail. The trail is about the width of a sidewalk and winds through the forest before reaching an overflow parking area. Cross the junction and continue straight as the short 1km route passes over a wooden bridge before exiting onto the gravel road in the loop at the end of the campground. Look for the Edge Farm Trail to the right, just at the end of the gravel road and take this trail as it follows the shoreline of the Fraser River closely. Many birds can be seen in the bushy areas along the shore and the grassy areas on the right of the trail. Continue along the 1.5km Edge Farm Trail as it runs alongside Allard Crescent before reaching the Historic Area parking lot at the end of the trail on the other side of the road. The Houston Trail starts from the parking lot of the Historic Area and is a 4km loop that is popular with walkers, hikers, and the occasional horseback rider. The trail starts to the right of the wooden signboard, where you walk down the small hill and go left along the wide trail. Continue along the wide trail until it meets a junction, where the loop begins, and go right to start the loop in a counter-clockwise direction. Follow the trail as it it makes its way through forested land along a gravel trail that sits above the boggy terrain and mud. The trail eventually reaches a parking lot called the Houston Trailhead, where there is space to park large horse transport trailers. To the left, the trail begins and continues its route through the forest, brushing alongside the golf course, before arriving at a junction. Go straight at the junction and continue as the trail descends downhill rapidly, before having to climb back up the other side again. Only a short distance further and you have returned to the original junction where you started the loop. Go right and return to the Historic Area parking lot. From here, to return to the Edgewater Bar area, cross the street and go left back along the Edge Farm Trail to the camping area. You can continue your return trip along the gravel road way that passes by each campsite."
Devil's Lake,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.75,3.8,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/devils-lake/,"The hike around Devil's Lake in Mission, BC, is a scenic forested loop with views of the area from the beach and the floating bridge on the south end of the lake. Although the hike is rated as easy, the trail is quite rugged along the east side of the lake as it passes through some rocky sections that are very uneven and can be slippery and muddy. The route crosses a floating bridge on the south end, with great views of the area. From the parking area at the side of the forest service road, walk down the wooden stairs and follow the trail downhill. The trail will descend and pass over a couple of wooden bridges as it heads towards Devil's Lake. Just after crossing a small stream, follow the trail to the right and out onto the beach area of Devil's Lake. This is the final stop for a lot of visitors to the area as they spend the day at the lakeside. Continue the hike around the lake by returning to the trail and following it into the forest heading north. The trail is well defined and easy to follow as it follows a route away from the lake with minimal views between the trees. The trail rounds the north end of the lake and then begins to ascend slightly as it passes along a rocky, rugged section. There are many ups and downs along the east side of the lake as you carefully step over the rocky terrain, watching your step as you descend through other sections. The trail will emerge from the forest cover and follow under a set of power lines before returning to the forest. The terrain becomes a bit easier before descending and, again, exiting the forest cover as you are almost alongside the lake. From here, you should be able to spot the floating wooden bridge up ahead. As you continue to walk towards it, look off to the side and back, enjoying the views of Devil's Lake and Rockwell Peak on the other side. Crossing the floating bridge provides one of the best views of the lake area. After enjoying the views, continue to follow the trail on the other side as it makes its way through the forest. The trail will eventually meet up with the trail you were on earlier, completing the lake loop near the beach access. Return to the parking area along the forest service road by following the trail uphill, crossing the wooden bridge before walking up the final set of wooden stairs."
Dilly Dally Loop,4.2,Tri Cities,Difficult,12.0,25.0,July - October,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/dilly-dally-loop/,"Many people are familiar with the hiking trails aroundBuntzen LakelikeSendero Diez Vistas, but less are familiar with a very challenging hike called the Dilly Dally Loop. The Dilly Dally Loop takes you along the Havlor Lunden Trail (sometimes called the Eagle Ridge Trail), up on the east side of Buntzen Lake, around Eagle Mountain and along a ridge to traverse Tangled Summit and Dilly Dally Peak, before dropping sharply back down beyond the north end of Buntzen Lake, and returning to the parking lot. This is a fun hike, with a variety of landscapes and spectacular views, but be warned, it is not for the inexperienced hiker. In fact, to start your hike there is a warning. You will do well to follow this advice, and only tackle this trail with a good amount of hiking experience. You will, of course, want to be carrying all the necessary safety essentials, and be sure you have plenty of water and also a purifier or filter if you plan to complete all 25km of this loop. The hike begins at the Buntzen Lake parking lot. Instead of walking to the beach, walk back out to the road immediately before parking lot entrances, and go into the area behind the closed gate. The trailhead is immediately beyond the gate, and there is a large signboard. The signboard has a map of the hike and gives you a nice history of Halvor Lunden, who built the trails you will be exploring today. The trail starts off easily enough, with a gradual but steady incline. This initial part of the trail is very well-marked and easy to navigate, but before long the trail will become much steeper. There will be no respite from the climb until you reach the first viewpoint - Polytrichum Lookout - at roughly 3 kilometers and 90 minutes into your hike. From this lookout, it will take roughly another 90 minutes to reach the next major landmark - Lindsay Lake. From the Polytrichum Lookout the trail flattens out a little bit. Shortly after the 4km point you will emerge from the trees into an open area with skies above. 200m to 300m beyond this opening, you will come to a major trail junction which is marked for ""Lindsay Lake / White Rock - Coquitlam Trails"". You want to follow the route marked in the direction for Lindsay Lake. Carrying on, you will come to another major junction, named the El Paso Junction, which will split off into two directions. Here, you have to make a decision whether you want to make your way around the east or west side of Eagle Mountain. Going right (the 'Lower Lakes' route) will be the more direct route, and will take you to a series of small lakes. The disadvantage of this route is that the lakes are quite small, and this route will normally be more muddy and boggy. The advantage is, there are more blueberry bushes along this route, so you can stock up if you're feeling hungry. Going left (the 'Viewpoints' route) will drop you down around the west side of Eagle Mountain and give you several great lookouts of Buntzen Lake, the Burrard Inlet and the general landscape out to the west. This is the recommended route if it is your first time hiking the Dilly Dally Loop, and this guide will describe going this way to Lindsay Lake. Going left at El Paso Junction, the trail will immediately cross a creek and the trail will gain and then lose some elevation as you begin to work your way around Eagle Mountain. At roughly 5.5km you will come to a viewpoint of Port Moody and the Burrard Inlet. This is a nice, wide and open spot to have a snack if you didn't stop at Polytrichum Lookout. Just a few minutes later along the trail you will come to another viewpoint which provides an even more amazing view. From this spot you can see the Indian Arm, Deep Cove, Mount Seymour, Vancouver and the Georgia Strait. From here, there is a short downhill section to a junction marked Spahat Rigg. At this junction you can either go straight for a shortcut, or left for a quick scramble and a nice view. Going left has a short technical section, but is worth the minor detour for the scenery. The choice is yours, however, as both trails quickly merge back together.
From Spahat Rigg, carry on along the trail following the markers and you will begin to pass a series of small lakes. Some are small enough to resemble ponds, however, several are very picturesque, such as Jessica Lake which you will reach at roughly 6.8km. One thing you will notice on this hike, is that the trail will gradually degrade the further you go from Polytrichum Lookout. Up to Poly, its very well maintain. As you move toward El Paso Junction, you'll notice the trail is less maintained. And as you approach Lindsay Lake, there is more and more deadfall. It does not make route-finding difficult but there are sections of trail that are diverted around deadfall, or that you will climb directly over. And beyond Dilly Dally Peak and Tangled Summit, it only gets worse. Following the markers, you will reach West Point Viewpoint at roughly kilometer 7.5. After West Point, you quickly reach two final viewpoints on this route around Eagle Mountain, and they offer the best views yet. You can see most of Buntzen Lake, and the sandy shore of its south beach. You also get a spectacular views of the Indian Arm, the Burrard Inlet, and if you look closely, even a tiny corner of Sasamat Lake below. Keep trudging along the trail and you will finally reach a major landmark on the hike - Lindsay Lake. A great spot for a quick swim on a hot day, and to grab some blueberries before carrying on. The trail will climb up directly from Lindsay Lake, and there is a marker that states it is 2.8km to Mount Beautiful. ""Mount Beautiful"" being an appropriate but unofficial name for Tangled Summit, which you will be climbing before reaching Dilly Dally Peak. From the lake it is about 1 hour to reach Tangled Summit. After a short climb much of the next stretch of trail is relatively flat. At kilometer 8.8 you will reach Dead Tree Pass, and at kilometer 9.7, Hemlock Pass. Both are marked with signs. Continue on the trail, following the flagging and markers until you reach Tangled Summit. This is arguably the best view you will get all day, so soak it up. In addition to the westward views you've already enjoyed, here you will get a full panorama. To the east you can see Coquitlam Lake directly below you. Beyond to the east you can see Widgeon Peak, Mount Burke, Coquitlam Mountain, the Fraser Valley and all the way to Mount Baker. After you have enjoyed the views, it's time to carry on northward along the ridge. From Tangled Summit/ Mount Beautiful, there is a short downhill scramble. It is hard to find the markers at some spots here, so proceed with caution and with a keen eye. You should at some point find a marker that states it is 1.58km to Dilly Dally Peak, but don't worry if you miss it. En route to Dilly Dally Peak you will come to a junction for Swan Falls. Don't take this junction, as it will take you straight back down the mountain directly to the northern tip of Buntzen Lake. However, if you come this far and are very tired, or otherwise worried about getting back to the parking lot before 8pm when the gates are closed, note that Swan Falls will be your fastest way out from this point (or alternatively turning back on the route you have taken here). Not far beyond the Swan Falls junction, at around 12km, you will come to 117 Lookout. This gives you a great view of Coquitlam Lake. From 117 Lookout, simply follow the trail along until at long last you summit Dilly Dally Peak. From Dilly Dally Peak with you again have lakes down below on both sides of you mountains all around. Here, you will also have a view of the northern end of the Indian Arm and Croker Island. From summit of Dilly Dally Peak, you will begin your long, strenuous descent off the ridge. There is no way of sugar-coating it - this stretch of trail is steep, overgrown, and very challenging. You will do well to not fall flat on your butt more than a few times. There is a good amount of deadfall, which sometimes runs the length of the trail, and thorny bushes will do their best to snag your shirt and scratch your legs. You have to make your way down for about an hour of this rough trail. Eventually, thankfully, the trail will open back up and you will shortly thereafter come to a creek crossing. This creek is mostly dry at the end of August, but still has water you can filter or purify if you have run out. You will then come to 157 Lookout which will give you a view looking back south onto the Indian Arm where you can see  Belcarra Bay, Jug Island, Racoon Island and Twin Islands. The trail from here is a relic from the logging days of an earlier time in history. Lots of deadfall, and broken cement and rebar from this old logging road will mark much of the final descent. When you come to a junction for ""Croker Island Viewpoint"", you are nearly back at lake-level. Croker Island lookout itself is a quick 10 minute detour and if you have the energy, is well worth it for the amazing view of the Indian Arm. From the Croker Island junction, you have about 2 hours of hiking remaining (but it is relatively easy hiking!). You will cross the creek again and you can fill up with water if needed. There are two other creek crossings shortly after. You will then come out to a power pylon and the trailhead for the northern end of the Halvor Lunden Trail in the small community of Buntzen Bay. Walk along the service road through and find your way past McCombe Lake to the north beach of Buntzen Lake. Now, simply follow the trail along the east side of Buntzen Lake back to the parking lot."
Dog Mountain,3.8,The North Shore,Easy,2.0,5.0,June - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/dog-mountain/,"The Dog Mountain Trail is a short, easy hike from Mount Seymour that offers a spectacular view of Vancouver on a clear day. While the trail has minimal elevation gain and is only about 5km return, it should be noted that the path is a bit more technical, requiring careful steps along several sections that are covered with slippery tree roots. Therefore, some hikers may find this trail on the more challenging end of the ""easy"" rating. From the parking lot, walk towards the BC Parks sign at the northwest corner. Walk north along the wide gravel trail for about 20 meters until you see a small sign and a trail that goes into the trees on your left. Enter and walk down the small hill to the first bridge crossing a small stream. The trail makes its way around tree roots and through rocky areas staying relatively flat with only the occasional small hill. In the winter, the trail is nice snowshoe along. After walking for 1.1km, you arrive at First Lake. Walk across the small bridge and along the lake shore to the sign on the far side pointing the way to Dog Mountain. It's just over 1km to Dog Mountain from this point, however the next section of the trail has a few more hills than the first. Continue along the trail making your way past the small streams and over cute little wooden bridges. As you near the peak of Dog Mountain, the trail will veer to the left. Continue along the path and step onto the rocky outcrop as you make your way out of the forest and towards the stunning view of North Vancouver below and Lions Gate Bridge, Stanley Park, and downtown Vancouver off in the distance. Have lunch and soak in the view before making your way back to the trail, walking back the way you came, eventually returning to the Mount Seymour parking lot."
Dorman Point,4.7,Howe Sound,Easy,1.0,2.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/dorman-point/,"Located in Crippen Regional Park on Bowen Island, the trail to Dorman Point is a short walk from the Snug Cove ferry terminal to a beautiful viewpoint looking out into Howe Sound. The view from the highest point at Dorman Point is obstructed by trees but a better view can be enjoyed from a short trail, downhill to the right. This is a fairly quick hike, so if you're planning to spend the day on Bowen Island, you might like to combine this route with another one toKillarney Lakeor the longer hike upMount Gardner. Although the trail is short, it does have a couple of steep sections, so good footwear is a must. From the Snug Cove ferry terminal, follow a wooden board walk path to the left as it heads away from the small community. Cross a wooden bridge and pass by the large field and picnic area as you follow the trail and enter the forest at the other side. Just after entering the forest, go left at a junction where there is a sign pointing to Dorman Point. The trail climbs gradually for a bit before turning to the right and becoming steeper as it makes its way up through a series of switchbacks. When the trail arrives at a road, go left and walk past the park sign up the hill. This is the steepest section of trail but it's quite short. Soon the trail levels out and you reach the highest point at Dorman Point. The trees have grown over the years and block much of the view from here. Continue by walking to the right, over the rocks and looking for a path along the dirt that heads downhill. Follow the path as you carefully make your way down some rocks and within a couple of minutes you arrive at a clearing with a scenic view of Howe Sound that looks down towards Dorman Bay. Return to Snug Cove the same route that you took, making sure to go right at the road and back down the trail."
Downes Bowl Trail,4.7,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,3.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/downes-bowl-trail/,"Downes Bowl is a scenic area with a network of hiking trails located in Clearbrook Park in Abbotsford. The bowl shaped terrain is unique in that the area has a large marsh with wooden boardwalks and small bridges that cross several streams. Dropping down into the bowl also makes for a quieter hiking experience even though the park is located near busy roads and sports fields. There are a number of trails in Downes Bowl and several routes you can take to explore the area. This description will follow the outer-most route as it loops through the bowl, returning to where you started. If you have extra time, it is worth exploring some of the inner trails too and the small bridges that cross the streams. The trail begins near the parking lot of Clearbrook Park and follows a gravel trail next to the baseball fields. When the trail reaches another trail, go right onto what's called the Discovery Trail and continue making your way around the baseball fields. Don't let the start of this hike disappoint you. After walking along the gravel trail around the baseball fields for about 400-meters, watch for a wide gravel trail to your left and follow that down a steep hill as you leave the noise of the sports fields and roads behind. Walk down along the wide gravel trail for about 300-meters and watch for a trail to the left. It will actually be the 3rd trail on your left but it's difficult to spot the first 2 trails. If the wide trail starts going uphill, you just missed the trail to the left and you are starting up the hill back to the area by the fields. After going left onto the trail, follow it into the scenic forest as it passes through a variety of terrain. A short distance later, go right at a junction and down across a wooden bridge. Follow the route as it meanders through the peaceful marsh area before crossing two more bridges and reaching another junction next to a fenced in area. Go right at this junction and within a couple of minutes, go left at a 2nd junction (do not go up the hill to your right as this trail goes to homes along Qualicum Street). Follow the trail as it does a large loop to the left, passing between two large marsh areas often filled with skunk cabbage in the spring and summer seasons. Continue following the trail until it reaches a junction and go right as the route gradually gains a bit of elevation before arriving at some wooden stairs that go down onto a long set of raised boardwalks. Cross the boardwalks and walk up a short hill on the far side to a 4-way intersection. At the 4-way intersection, take the trail in the middle, the narrower one, as it will be the outmost part of the loop through Downes Bowl. Follow this trail as it begins to climb steeply up to the highest point in the park. Unfortunately, there is no view from this point and it only offers a good workout. Follow the trail down the other side and go right at each of the junctions until you reach the bottom. At a junction just before the trail ascends steeply again, it's at this point you must decide whether to extend your hike and explore some of the inner trails. For this route description, we'll continue up the steep hill, the steepest grade of trail in the park, until you reach the top of a mound, where the gravel trail next to the baseball fields can be seen a mere few steps away. Walk to the gravel trail and go right, following the trail a short distance, before turning left and heading back to the parking lot where you began."
Dragon's Back Trail,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,3.5,5.4,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/dragons-back-trail/,"The Dragon's Back Trail (Kw’okw’echíwel Stl’áleqem) in Hope, BC, is a steep forested trail that passes several viewpoints, including a view of Mount Hope, the Silver Creek neighbourhood, the town of Hope, and the Fraser River. The hike is fairly steep in some areas but the viewpoints offer a nice reward and place to stop and enjoy. The cumulative elevation gain for this hike is closer to 435-metres as there is a downhill section after the Silver Creek Viewpoint followed by more uphill. The trail is steep in sections and can be slippery even during the summer months, so make sure to wear shoes with good traction. From the gravel parking lot, follow the trail past the wooden sign and begin heading uphill into the forest. The trail climbs quickly through this section, including up several well maintained wooden steps. After a steady climb, you reach the first view with a sign for the ""Hope Mountain Viewpoint"". The wooden benches offer a nice rest spot with a view before continuing. The trail continues uphill and through the steepest section of the route. Carefully make your way up the wooden steps and through some of the narrow switchbacks before eventually reaching the second view with a sign for the ""Silver Creek Viewpoint"". After passing the viewpoint, the trail descends through a series of switchbacks. As the trail begins to level, you reach an area called the ""Stone Garden"". Located several metres off of the main trail the Stone Garden is a spectacular granite face that is home to several rare plants. The sensitive ecology makes it inappropriate for a climbing area but it still is a spectacular point of interest to visit. Pass the Stone Garden and continue following the main trail as it begins to climb uphill again. The route eventually meets a sign marking the junction around the top of the hill. Go right to begin the loop and continue to follow the well defined trail as it climbs at a gentler pace than earlier. There is a rope assist at one steep point, use it to pull yourself up the trail and continue as the path opens onto a rocky bluff with an initial view. Walk around to the left, towards the wooden benches to the Summit Viewpoint where an incredible view looking over the town of Hope, BC, and the Fraser River awaits. The Summit View is the best view along the Dragon's Back Trail. After enjoying the Summit View, continue to follow the trail around the loop as it meanders through the forest before descending down a section. Use a second rope assist to pull yourself up another steep hill before arriving at the West Viewpoint. This viewpoint looks down towards the Highway and the Fraser River as it flows downstream. Follow the trail along the loop as it gently descends and eventually returns to the loop junction. From the junction, go right and begin the descent back downhill towards the Stone Garden. The toughest part of the return is after the Stone Garden where you have to ascend through the series of switchbacks up to the Silver Creek Viewpoint. Pass the Silver Creek Viewpoint and begin the steep descent back down the trail, being careful where you step on some of the steep and small wooden steps. The trail passes the Hope Mountain Viewpoint and continues back downhill until you eventually return to the gravel parking lot where you began your hike."
Eagle Bluffs,4.4,The North Shore,Intermediate,4.0,9.0,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/eagle-bluffs/,"Located on the rocky slopes above Eagle Harbour in West Vancouver lies a spectacular view from Eagle Bluffs. Most hikers access Eagle Bluffs from the downhill ski area of Cypress Mountain following the Baden Powell Trail as this route passes some other great scenery, including Cabin Lake and Black Mountain. From the parking lot of the downhill ski area, walk towards the wooden sign board with a map of the trails around the Cypress Mountain area. The hike to Eagle Bluffs begins to the left of the map as you walk towards the Eagle Express Quad Chairlift. As you approach the chairlift, veer onto a trail to the right of the chairlift and continue to follow this trail. Eagle Bluffs is not mentioned on signage often, however you will follow the Baden Powell Trail which is marked by the distinctive ""BP"" trail markers on the trees. Follow the trail and go left at the first sign as you quickly leave the area near the chairlift. At a second sign next to a bridge over Cypress Creek, go left and begin your hike up the steep hill towards Black Mountain. The trail begins to climb as you ascend quickly through a series of switchbacks. Take some time for an occasional rest by looking back at the views as you quickly gain elevation through this steep section of trail. Shortly after a steep hill that hugs the edge of a ski run, you reach a small lake on your left. Continue to follow the well defined route as the hiking trail gradually weaves through a section with a more gradual incline. When the trail reaches a sign at a junction, go right and a short distance away lies Cabin Lake. Just before Cabin Lake, there is a sign that marks a short 250 meter side trail that leads up to the Yew Lake viewpoint, also known as the northern peak of Black Mountain. There are great views of the Lions from this high point and, if you cross to an adjacent ridge, views in the opposite direction of Bowen Island and the southern tip of the Sunshine Coast. Back on the main trail by Cabin Lake, continue to the end of the boardwalk and onto the trail for a short 10 minute hike to the southern peak of Black Mountain. Climbing up on the short rocky outcrop of Black Mountain gives you another angle of the Lions. This is a good place to stop for a snack but watch out for the ravens who try to steal your lunch when you are not looking. Return to the trail and continue as it begins to descend downhill through the forest before reaching Owen Lake. Just past Owen Lake, the trail arrives at another junction at which point going right takes you to Eagle Bluffs and left returns via a loop back to the junction near Cabin Lake. Go right and follow the trail to Eagle Bluffs as it passes by several muddy sections and several small lakes, including Cougar Lake. After another 20 minutes, the trail begins to descend quickly as you carefully step down a steep rocky section and into a thicker forested area. After hiking downhill for some distance, a clearing suddenly emerges up ahead as you approach the spectacular view at Eagle Bluffs. The view is breathtaking on a sunny day as the marina at Eagle Harbour can be seen below and the city of Vancouver off in the distance. On exceptionally clear days you can see as far as Vancouver Island to the west and even the snowy slopes of Mount Baker to the south. After enjoying the view, return to the Cypress Mountain are by walking back up the same route that you took earlier. After a 40 minute uphill hike and passing back through the muddy sections, you arrive at a junction with a sign to the Cypress downhill area. Take the trail on the right, which will bypass Black Mountain, which will instead pass Theagill Lake and Sam Lake. Just after the two lakes, go left to continue the loop until you arrive at the junction near Cabin Lake where you passed earlier. Go right at the junction near Cabin Lake and follow the route you hiked up earlier, watching your step as you walk down the trail over the loose rocks. Pass through the switch backs and stay to the right at the Yew Lake junctions. A short distance further and you will arrive back next to the chairlift where you began your hike."
Eagle Bluffs via Horseshoe Bay,4.0,The North Shore,Difficult,7.5,11.5,June - October,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/eagle-bluffs-horseshoe-bay/,"The hike to Eagle Bluffs from Horseshoe Bay is a steep route that follows the Baden Powell Trail to the incredible viewpoint. The trail passes close toWhyte Lakebefore continuing uphill and entering Cypress Provincial Park. Note that it is more common to hike toEagle Bluffs from the Cypress downhill ski areaat the top. This route has limited parking at the trailhead and is more difficult. The hike begins from the small parking lot next to the old Sea To Sky road near the Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal ticket booths. Walk through the gate, past the sign and the trail immediately climbs very steeply uphill. After a 5-10 steep incline, the path levels and follows alongside the rocky wall of Highway #99. Follow the trail underneath the highway where it reaches a sign on the other side. Go left at the sign and follow alongside the highway for a short distance until the trail gradually veers away from the highway. After walking up a small hill, you reach a clearing next to a metal gate and Highway #99. Go right up the steep hill as you leave the highway area for good. The trail climbs quickly up an old access road. After 10-minutes of steep uphill, the trail levels briefly as you quickly make time but then begins to climb again. Eventually, you reach a sign that points to the right to Whyte Lake. Go left and continue following the Baden Powell Trail uphill until the trail briefly levels before continuing uphill once again. Go left at a junction and stay on the wide, old road. At the end of the wide, old road, a trail begins and continues uphill as you reach a BC Parks' sign marking the boundary of the Provincial Park. Continue following the narrow Baden Powell Trail, watching your step as you make your way up the rocky route. The trail passes through a scenic section, crossing a creek. During the spring and early summer, the creek can be running high and crossing along the log is your best option. Once you have crossed the creek, the trail will climb significantly as some of the steepest sections remain before reaching Eagle Bluffs. After hiking for over a couple of hours in the forest, the trail emerges at a boulder field. Scramble up the rocks, keeping to the right and following the occasional orange marker. At the top, the trail continues its relentless climb in the forest as you make your way up some switchbacks. As you near the top, there is a viewpoint from a rocky bluff. Eagle Bluffs is a bit further beyond this point. Follow the route up the rocks and through the trees as it rounds a corner, bringing you up onto Eagle Bluffs. The view is incredible as you look down towards the entrance to Howe Sound and across towards the city. After enjoying the view, being the hike back downhill by following the trail on the east side of Eagle Bluffs where you arrived. Follow the worn route past the lower viewpoint and disappear into the forest as you descend quickly along the steep trail. Watch your footing and take your time on the boulder field, loose rocks, and tree roots. After descending along the Baden Powell for quite sometime, cross back over the creek and continue as you pass the BC Parks' sign. Not much further and the narrow trail reaches the old road. Follow the access road back downhill until you reach the junction with the Whyte Lake Trail. It is only a short 500-metres to Whyte Lake from the Baden Powell Trail and worth a visit if you have some remaining energy. From the Whyte Lake Trail junction, follow the road back down towards the highway, crossing under the highway, and making the final descent back to the parking lot area."
Elfin Lakes,4.5,Howe Sound,Intermediate,6.0,22.0,July - October,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/elfin-lakes/,"A free day-use pass is required from the Diamondhead trailhead fromJune 13 to October 13, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. Elfin Lakes are two small lakes located in the scenic alpine setting of Garibaldi Provincial Park near Squamish, British Columbia. From the parking lot, pass the yellow gate and begin heading uphill along the wide gravel road. Originally, this was the main road to access the old Diamond Head Lodge at Elfin Lakes. However, it is solely used today by hikers and mountain bikers to access Elfin Lakes. After hiking for just over an hour, you arrive at the shelter at Red Heather Meadows. The shelter is used in the winter by snowshoers and cross-country skiers as a place to warm up and in the summer months as a place for hikers to use the outhouse just beyond the building. As you continue up the trail past the shelter, follow the narrow hiking trail for the next kilometer. The vegetation begins to thin and becomes very sensitive as you approach the alpine area. The narrow trail eventually joins back up with the wide gravel road. Go left and continue gradually heading uphill, admiring the beautiful alpine scenery to your left. As the trail begins to level, the two huts at Elfin Lakes can be seen off in the distance. For the next 30 minutes, the trail descends towards the Elfin Lakes before arriving at a view above the lakes of the surrounding area. Make the final descent down towards the first lake and stop to take photos and enjoy the view. People are allowed to swim in the top lake, however the lower lake is reserved for drinking water only and must be kept clean. The ranger station is just beyond the second lake and a bit further down the trail is the overnight shelter used by hikers who plan on hiking to further destinations such as Opal Cone, the Gargoyles, or Mamquam Lake. After stopping for lunch at the lakes, head back onto the trail in the direction you arrived from. The first section is a steady uphill climb as you make your way back up to the rocky ridge. Once there, it's all gradually downhill as you continue towards the warming shelter leaving the alpine scenery behind. Pass the warming hut and head back downhill towards the parking lot where you began your day."
Elk Mountain,4.6,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,5.0,8.0,June - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/elk-mountain/,"The top of Elk Mountain offers a spectacular view of Chilliwack, Cultus Lake, mountains to the south, and the surrounding Fraser Valley area. The hiking trail is steep and relentless with the majority of the route being in the forest and along a well defined path. During the summer, the dry, loose dirt along several steep sections can be slippery, particularly as you approach the first viewpoint. The hike begins from the wooden map board along Elk View Road and starts with a steady incline up the mountain through a beautifully forested area. The trail is wide and easy to navigate as you make your way uphill, passing over a small creek. The trail eventually reaches a gravel forestry road. Cross the road and continue to follow the trail back into the forest, continuing uphill. The trail continues its relentless uphill climb until you reach a portion where you can spot the valley through the trees. At this point, the trail veers right and gets steeper. Follow the switchbacks up the steep section and be careful to watch for orange markers on the trees. Eventually, the trail climbs up some wooden steps and emerges from the forest where there is immediately a view of valley looking southwest. Continue up the loose dirt to the first Elk Mountain Viewpoint, which is a rocky bluff that is to the left of the trail. The view is incredible on a clear day as you can see Cultus Lake and the town of Chilliwack. Return to the trail and continue up the steep hill under the forest canopy. The uphill section is short as you leave the forest again and there is a final steep uphill to a clearing where there are more great views looking south. There is an outhouse located near here, just back in the treeline. Continue to follow the trail along the ridge as you soak in all of the spectacular views. If you are lucky with the timing of your hike, the wildflowers will be blooming along the trail edges, presenting an array of colours. Pass some flags and a green sheet used as a launching area for paragliders. The highest point is a rocky, open clearing that is unmarked and this is the peak of Elk Mountain. The views look south across the valley and some of the mountains visible include Mount McGuire, Mount McFarlane, Slesse Mountain, and even as far south as Mount Baker in the United States. The trail continues to Mount Thurston, however the best views are along Elk Ridge, so most people end their hike at the peak of Elk mountain and return. Once you've enjoyed the views, begin hiking back along the route you arrived, enjoying the views along the ridge one last time. Step carefully along the loose dirt trail as you walk down the steep trail returning to the first viewpoint. Go left, and slowly make your way down the steep hill as you return to the forest. The trail descends quickly as you zig zag your way back through the switch backs. When the trail becomes less steep, the descent becomes even quicker as you pass the gravel road and descend the last section of trail back to the trailhead where you began."
Enchanted Forest,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,0.5,1.3,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/enchanted-forest/,"The Enchanted Forest on Pender Island is located in a lush west coast rainforest on the Southern Island. The walk through the forest is fairly easy, with a trail that descends down to a waterfall (dry in the summer) and viewpoint. From Spalding Road, walk under the wooden sign and enter the forest. Go left on the trail that is parallel to the road and continue until you reach a junction. Continue on the trail to the left towards the waterfall as the trail heads deeper into the forest and begins to descend. Not too far along the trail, you reach a wooden bench with a view of the waterfall. The waterfall is usually dry during the summer months and after long periods of sunshine, however it's a rellaxing sight to see the water flowing over the edge during the fall and early spring. Continue down the trail as it descends quickly before going up a few rocky steps. The trail passes through a grove of trees, including the beautiful arbutus trees with their shedding bark. A short distance further and the trail ends with a semi-obstructed view through the trees of Bedwell Harbour. Return via the same trail, walking back uphill and into the forest, passing the wooden bench by the waterfall and returning to the junction. To do a short loop through the forest, go left and follow the boardwalks as you enjoy the trees and fauna of the rainforest. Go right at a second junction to continue looping through the forest, then a few more steps and you've reached the wooden sign where you began your hike."
Falls Lake,5.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,2.0,May - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/falls-lake/,"Falls Lake is a beautiful lake located in the subalpine of the Coquihalla Summit Recreation Area between the towns of Hope and Merritt. The trail is a short, well marked route that follows a creek right to the shores of the lake, offering scenic views of Nak Peak to the left and Zoa Peak to the right. From the gravel parking lot, walk up the road on the right side and within about 20-meters, a sign on the left will point in the direction to Falls Lake. Go left at the sign and head uphill into the forest, following the creek down below to your left. The trail initially climbs quickly but the ascend is more gradual as you continue through the forest, crossing a couple of small wooden bridges. The sound of the rushing creek below can be heard through most of the hike but only small glimpses of it can be seen. As the trail plateaus, it begins to descend slightly and the first views of the lake can be seen in-between the trees. A few more steps and you arrive at the incredible view of Falls Lake where the towering Nak Peak sits on the left side of the lake. After enjoying the view, head back down the trail in the direction you arrived, following the well worn back to the gravel parking lot area where you began."
Fisherman's Trail,3.2,The North Shore,Easy,5.0,12.0,year-round,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/fishermans-trail/,"From the parking lot area, walk to the east side and look for a trail that heads into the forest. Follow it and almost immediately, a trail to the left marked with a sign for the Homestead Trail heads steeply downhill. Follow the Homestead Trail as you quickly descend into the lush forest of the Seymour River area. The end of the Homestead Trail joins with the Fisherman's Trail along the Seymour River. At the Fisherman's Trail, go left and pass the wooden gates as you begin your long walk up river. The first section doesn't offer much of a view of the river but continue along as the trail passes by moss covered trees and fallen logs providing plenty of fresh forest air to breath in. Eventually the Fisherman's Trail follows alongside the Seymour River, offering views of the river and some of the mountain ranges to the east. The route continues for quite a distance, passing over the occasional bridge, through a couple of narrow sections where mud slides have damaged the trail all the while seeing very few people along the route. The trail climbs up a hill, passing a sign with directions and distances before reaching a paved road. Cross the paved road and hike up the steep gravel trail on the other side. As you round a corner, walk up over the grass to the Mid Valley Viewpoint, where there is a covered area and several picnic tables. This is a beautiful spot to stop for lunch and enjoy the surrounding scenery. After you have enjoyed the view at the Mid Valley Viewpoint, walk back down the trail that you arrived and rejoin the Fisherman's Trail across the road at the bottom, beginning the 6km walk back to the parking lot. Go right onto the Homestead Trail and hike up the steep hill, returning to the parking lot."
Flood Falls,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,0.75,1.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/flood-falls/,"Located in Hope, BC, Flood Falls spectacularly drops from high above onto the rocks near a small pool of water. The waterfall is quite high with a narrow band of water and it's just a short walk from the parking area, just off of Highway #1. From the trail head, follow the trail into the forest and walk up the well worn path along the creek bed. Depending on the time of year you hike the route, the creek bed is often dry. The path weaves through the forest as it gently gains elevation. Within 15-20 minutes, the sound of Flood Falls can be heard and just a few more steps, the waterfall can be first spotted between the trees. Follow the trail as it arrives at a clearing, before walking up a rocky mound in front of the waterfall. Make sure to use caution when standing near the base of the waterfall as rocks can cascade over the falls from the top. After you have enjoyed the waterfall, follow the forested trail back downhill, staying near the creek bed until the path exits the forest next to the road where you parked."
Foreshore Trail,3.7,Vancouver City,Easy,3.0,5.0,year-round,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/foreshore-trail/,"The Foreshore Trail is a scenic beach route in Pacific Spirit Regional park that follows around the west side of the University of British Columbia and passes through Wreck Beach and Acadia Beach. The hike provides scenic views looking westward out into the Strait of Georgia and northwest to Bowen Island and the entrance to Howe Sound. A few words of warning before trying this hike, more than half of the trail follows the beach, which is rocky, slippery, and can be challenging at times during high tides. There are many sections where there used to be a trail but the land has eroded and is only passable via the beach, so caution should be taken while walking on the rocks and the route is best hiked during low tides. In addition, the trail passes directly through Wreck Beach, which is Vancouver's only nudist beach, and it should be expected that there will be people without clothes enjoying the sunshine. From the parking lot at Acadia Beach, walk down the trail towards the beach. Continue past a trail that splits to the left and walk onto the beach, heading westbound. Much of the route to Trail #3 is along the rocky beach and this section will take longer than some of the areas with a defined hiking trail. As you walk along the rocks, you can faintly see an area above the tide line where the rocks are pressed down and most people walk. Enjoy the scenic views as you make your way around the northwestern section of Point Grey. The view looks out towards West Vancouver, Bowen Island, and the entrance to Howe Sound. You can often see one of the ferries in the distance heading to or returning from Nanaimo. The first point of interest is an old World War II instrument tower that sits along the beach. The tower was part of the defence system for Vancouver to warn of a possible attack coming from the Pacific. Today, the graffiti covered tower sits along the beach as a memory of the past. From the tower, follow the dirt trail and within a minute, you reach the well marked junction and stairs for Trail #3. This leads up to NW Marine Drive and is the first exit point along the beach. Continue following the Foreshore Trail as it ends shortly and you return to walking along the beach. The terrain of the beach becomes sandier as you continue to make your way around Point Grey. A second tower is visible in the distance and you quickly approach it. It too is locked and covered in graffiti but was also part of the important defence system during World War II. Continue walking and within 5-minutes, you reach the junction with Trail #4, offering the second exit to NW Marine Drive. As you continue your hike, you round the corner and enter the Wreck Beach area. On a sunny day, the beach is busy with many people sunbathing in the buff. Just after passing the showers, there is a junction with Trail #6 which leads back up to the UBC area. From this junction, follow the hiking trail that follows the beach area but heads into the trees. This section can be quite muddy during the winter or after a rainfall, however when it's dry, it's much quicker to walk along than the previous beach areas as you will be following a trail the rest of the route. The trail follows the shoreline as you are now located across from the Iona Beach area, which acts as a breakwater and protects the beach from the waves. There are still areas along the trail where there are sunbathers so continue hiking and keep people's privacy in mind when enjoying the views of the scenery. The trail eventually reaches the junction with Trail #7 after about 1-hour of hiking from Wreck Beach. At this point, the trail does continue further, however it's recommended to follow Trail #7 back up to NW Marine Drive and return via the UBC campus. Trail #7 follows a creek and heads up a very steep set of wooden stairs to Old Marine Drive. At the top, go left and walk up to NW Maine Drive. The easiest way to return to the Acadia Beach parking lot is to walk back along NW Maine Drive. Make sure to go left at the 4-way intersection and continue following NW Marine Drive, not Chancellor Blvd. Walking back down the hill will return you to the parking lot. Note, the total distance is not included in the return trip because some people will choose to walk back via the NW Marine Drive route described, some via the beach, or some might take a different route through the University campus."
Fort To Fort Trail,5.0,Surrey and Langley,Easy,2.5,8.0,year-round,True,False,True,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/fort-to-fort/,"The walking route known as the Fort To Fort Trail connects the Fort Langley National Historical Museum with the site of the original fort near Derby Reach Regional Park. The 4km trail is a popular walking or family-friendly biking path. The route begins from the National Historic Museum but many people begin the route from the train crossing at Glover Road and Mavis Avenue. At the end of the Fort To Fort Trail, you can extend your route by following the Edgewater Trail or completing the Houston Trail loop in Derby Reach Regional Park before returning along the Fort To Fort Trail back to Fort Langley. From the National Historical Museum, walk along Mavis Avenue heading westbound to the intersection with Glover Road. Cross the train tracks and immediately go left along Billy Brown Road for about 40-metres to a circular opening with benches and historical information about logging. Cross the street and walk towards the river, veering left onto the gravel trail and heading west along the Fraser River. The trail leaves the busy Fort Langley area and follows the a gravel path with several small wooden piers offering scenic views of the nearby waterway. Pass over a small channel as you leave the sight of homes and continue following the trail behind the Fort Langley Golf Course. Eventually, the Fort To Fort trail reaches a road as you continue to follow the gravel path along the side of Allard Crescent. The trail veers to the right and leaves the road, passing scenic meadow views. As the trail approaches the road once again, the Fort To Fort Trail ends where by a parking lot across the street for Derby Reach Regional Park. From this point, you can either return via the same route, cross the street to the parking lot area to walk around the Houston Trail, or continue in the same direction you arrived along the Edgewater Trail further into Derby Reach park."
Francis Point Provincial Park,5.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,1.5,3.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/francis-point/,"Francis Point Provincial Park is a beautiful park that is located along the Sunshine Coast near Madeira Park. The trail is short but follows a rocky route along the coastline providing scenic views of the Strait of Georgia, looking across towards Texada Island. From the parking lot, follow the trail into the forest, enjoying the peacefulness of the lush west coast rainforest with every step. Within a few minutes, you arrive at Francis Bay, where you can make your way to the edge of the water to look out onto the waterway. Return to the trail follow it southward as it crosses a small wooden bridge and then arrives at a rocky outcrop that overlooks the bay. Continue to follow the trail along the coastline, carefully watching your step as you make your way up over the rocks and back down again. Be especially careful if the rocks are wet, they can be very slippery. The trail continues along the shoreline, offering many views of the Strait of Georgia as you look across to Texada Island. Eventually, the trail descends down a steep section between some rocks where it arrives at a spectacular grove of Arbutus trees. Walk down to the rocky outcrop where the lighthouse beacon can be see. This is the end of the trail. The views from the end are more than 180-degrees as you can see fairly far south as well as across the Strait towards Texada. If you're lucky, you may even spot some marine wildlife, such as seals or even whales. Take one last look at the view before walking back up towards the grove of arbutus trees and beginning to follow the trail back. Carefully hike up the steep section and then watch your step as you make your way over the rocks, back along the route. Returning to the area where you first had a view of Francis Bay, go right and walk back up the trail, returning to the parking lot where you began."
Frosty Mountain,4.4,Manning Provincial Park,Difficult,8.0,22.0,July - September,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/frosty-mountain/,"Frosty Mountain in Manning Provincial Park is a challenging hike that takes you into the alpine to a viewpoint on the first peak that provides a spectacular view of surrounding Coastal Mountain ranges. The trail steadily ascends and some scrambling over loose rocks is required before reaching the top but the views on a clear day are some of the best in the park. The trail begins from the Lightning Lake day-use area. From the parking lot, walk to the east end of Lightning Lake and follow the trail for about 100 meters until you see a small wooden sign for Frosty Mountain. The trail enters the forest and immediately veers right, climbing steadily. You will catch glimpses of the Lightning Lake between the trees and continue to hear people at the beach as you make your way uphill through the steep switchbacks. As you gain more elevation, there are a couple of clearings where you can see the beautiful colours of Lightning Lake and Flash Lake. Just before a switchback, there is a small, red marker on a tree with the 4km mark. Just after this point, the trail begins to level and even slightly descend in a few areas as you pick up the pace and begin to quickly gain some distance. Walk past a wooden ""Camp"" sign and, within a few minutes, you arrive at the Frosty Creek Campsite. There is an outhouse, tenting areas, and a small wooden structure that can be used as a shelter. Step over Frosty Creek and follow the trail as you leave the campsite and the route begins to climb again through another series of switch backs. Eventually, the trail begins to open up and leave the tree cover and view of Mount Frosty can be seen up ahead. After passing through a fairly flat section of trail in a meadow, the trail begins to climb quickly, offering spectacular views on both sides of the route. The trail reaches the section where there is plenty of loose rock and requires some route finding and scrambling. The trail is not marked through this section so care must be taken to follow the worn path over the loose rock and to watch your footing as you do so. The route climbs steeply, zig-zagging slightly until you reach the top of the ridge at a wooden sign post marking the junction with the Windy Joe route. Note this junction as you will need to return to this point. Continue to the right, walking along the ridge, watching where you step as you take in the views. Make your way up the final ascent onto Frosty where a wooden post marks the elevation at 2,408 meters. The view from the top is incredible as you can see all the peaks in Manning, including the Three Brothers in the distance to the north. The view looking south is probably the most spectacular as all the mountains to the south are located in the United States portion of the Cascade Range. After enjoying the views, begin your descent back down by following the worn trail over the rocks. Be careful to stay on track and aim for the ridge that you walked up earlier as there are no markers to guide you. Follow the ridge back towards the wooden sign at the junction to the Windy Joe route but go left, following the same route back down the rocks in which you came from. Be careful descending this section as the rocks are loose and slippery. Once the rocky section ends, follow the trail back downhill as you quickly descend and make your way through the meadows. The views disappear behind you and you follow the trail through the forest returning to Frosty Creek Campsite. Continue following the route as it passes along a flat section, before reaching the tiny, red marker with the 4km distance. Begin the descent back down the switchbacks as you begin to see views of Lightning Lake and return to where you began you hike."
Garibaldi Lake,4.5,Whistler,Intermediate,6.0,18.0,July - October,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/garibaldi-lake/,"A free day-use pass is required from the Rubble Creek trailhead fromJune 13 to October 13, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. With turquoise-coloured water nestled between alpine mountains and a spectacular glacier as the backdrop, Garibaldi Lake is one of the most scenic destinations in British Columbia. Accessible from the Rubble Creek parking lot just south of Whistler, the hike begins at the wooden steps along the top section of the parking lot. The first 6km of the trail is a gradual uphill climb through dense forests of Douglas Fir trees. At times, the trail can seem like it goes on forever, however keep moving as the reward will be well worth the effort. Shortly after the 6km mark, you reach a junction with a map of the surrounding area. Going right takes you directly to Garibaldi Lake, the perfect option for those who may be short on time or want a shorter hike. However, going left and adding a few kilometers onto the hike takes you up through Taylor Meadows, a magnificent area filled with colours from alpine flowers that cover the sides of the trail during the late summer and early fall. At the junction, go left and head towards Taylor Meadows. After another 20 minutes of gradual uphill, the trail begins to level and you arrive at the Taylor Meadows campsite. Looking up to the left between the trees reveals the towering peak of Black Tusk. Continue along the trail through the meadows occasionally stopping to check out the view behind you. The meadows are very sensitive to any sort of foot traffic, so it is important that hikers stay on the marked trails in order to protect and promote the growth of this ecologically sensitive environment. Eventually, you arrive at another main junction where you have the choice of continuing to Black Tusk or Panorama Ridge. We will save these long and difficult hikes for another day and head off to the right towards Garibaldi Lake. The trail continues it's meandering path through the meadows for the next 20 minutes. The trail eventually begins to head downhill through a series of switchbacks offering  the occasional views of the turquoise-coloured lake through the trees. Once you reach the bottom of the switchbacks, watch for a sign and a trail that goes down a steep dirt slope. Take this path as it heads down towards the river draining from Garibaldi Lake and a wooden bridge crossing. Cross the bridge and continue to the left towards the lake. As you continue walking, the lake becomes more and more visible until you reach a wooden structure where the trees open up completely revealing a panoramic view of the entire lake and glacier off in the distance. From this point on, there are several places that offer scenic views. Pick one that is less busy and stop to take a break and soak up the view. Once you are satisfied you have taken enough photos and are ready to head back to the parking lot, walk back alongside the lake where you came towards the wooden bridge that crosses the river. Head up the steep path to the junction but this time, go left. This trail will go directly to the first junction, bypassing Taylor Meadows. Continue along the trail as it passes two other smaller lakes that Garibaldi Lake drains into. These lakes also offer beautiful scenery but they are not quite as spectacular as their mother lake. After passing the second lake, continue into the forest and a short distance later the first junction appears that you passed earlier in the day. Continue straight back downhill towards the Rubble Creek parking lot. The next 6km are long but keep in mind the accomplishment and reward of getting to enjoy one of the most beautiful places in British Columbia."
George Hill Trail,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Intermediate,1.0,1.7,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/george-hill-trail/,"The George Hill Trail is located on the northern island of Pender Island and hikers can enjoy sweeping views of the Southern Gulf Island region from the top. The hike has a couple of steep sections of trail but rewarding views make the effort well worth it. Starting from the trailhead on Ogden Road, follow the trail into the forest and veer left as the trail gradually climbs. Watch your step as you make your way up the uneven trail. The trail briefly levels in a small grove before continue up a steep section of hill as you quickly make your way to the top. As the trail again levels, follow  the worn path through the trees. There is a viewpoint on the right, however it's partially obstructed and pales in comparison to the views at the top. When the trail reaches a junction, go left at the junction and continue to follow the route as it begins to again climb steeply. Keep on the worn path and watch your footing as trail can be slippery, even during drier weather. The trail again begins to level and a viewpoint sits just off to the left of the main trail. Walk to the viewpoint to see an incredible view looking Southwest down towards Otter Bay and across to Salt Spring Island. This is one of the best views but there is also an excellent view a short distance further up the main trail that looks more northward towards Prevost, Mayne, and Galiano Islands. There is a junction near both peaks that follows a trail that goes to Clam Bay Road, however there are no views nearby that are as good as the two views at the top. Don't take this trail, unless you have a reason to hike down to Clam Bay Road. After enjoying the views, return via the route you arrived, following the trail back down hill. At the junction, stay right and continue along the route, returning back down the steep, forested trail to Ogden Road where you began."
Goat Mountain,4.1,The North Shore,Intermediate,4.0,8.0,July - October,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/goat-mountain/,"Goat Mountain and all other backcountry trails in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park are nowclosedfor the season. The trail will re-open in roughly July 2025, or when the snow and conditions allow. Goat Mountain is a picturesque hike that starts from the top of the Grouse Mountain Ski Resort. On a sunny, clear day, the top of Goat Mountain can offer views of Vancouver and even as far away as Mount Baker, Vancouver Island, and some of the mountain ranges in Garibaldi Provincial Park near Squamish. From the top of the Grouse Mountain Skyride, follow the paved path, going left towards the Peak chairlift, the highest ski run that is visible in the distance. The paved path will pass the logging show area and grizzly bear pen before becoming a gravel pathway. Veer to the left as the path begins to gradually ascend, with a rocky mountainside on the right and a cliff with a view down towards the Capilano Watershed on the left. After walking for 15 minutes, you arrive at a wooden sign on a board that has trail maps of the area. Continue past the sign and up the steep rocky slope as the trail goes through a few short switchbacks before reaching the Dam Mountain junction. At the sign, go right towards Goat Mountain and continue walking along the trail as it levels slightly. As you continue your hike, look to your right at the scenic view of the mountains and the occasional glimpse of Kennedy Lake below. The trail eventually arrives at another sign, which points to the right in the direction of Goat Mountain. Walk down the hill and a few minutes later, you arrive at yet another junction. Go straight, following the clearly marked route. On your left, the jagged peak of Crown Mountain stands high above while up ahead you begin to see the rounded shape of Goat Mountain. After a relatively flat stretch of trail, you arrive at a steep section with a rope and chain to help pull yourself up and over the tree routes. Continue to the right as the trail wraps around Goat Mountain before reaching a sign that leads to Goat Ridge off to the right. A short side trip to Goat Ridge offers a different view down towards the Hanes Valley. The last stretch of Goat Mountain is steep, however it only take 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Make your way up the steep slope in the final scramble onto the peak to witness the full panoramic view. Walk around the top and find the perfect spot to enjoy the view while you eat your lunch. After enjoying the scenery, head back towards the orange markers and make your way down the steep section and back onto the trail. Follow the route you took, passing the clearly marked signs heading back towards Grouse Mountain."
Gold Creek Falls,4.1,Ridge Meadows,Easy,2.0,5.5,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/gold-creek-falls/,"A free day-use pass is required for all hiking trails in Golden Ears Provincial Park fromMay 16 to September 1, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. The Gold Creek Falls is a short hike that is perfect for the beginning of the season or in combination with a camping trip to the Golden Ears Provincial Park. From the parking lot, head down towards the trail and start following the wide trail up a gradual hill. Layers of moss blanket the forest floor as you make your way through a typical west coast rainforest. After hiking for about 15 minutes, you will get a glimpse of Gold Creek on your left. Continue along the trail until you reach a clearing that offers views of Alouette, Edge, and Blanchard Mountains. As you begin to make your way uphill, you will start to hear Gold Creek Falls as you get closer. The view of the falls above can be fantastic, particularly in the spring season when the runoff from the surrounding mountains is surging downstream. After taking in the view and mist from the falls, continue up the trail to the next viewpoint at the top of the falls. After enjoying the upper viewpoint, make your way back down, past the falls, and head back towards the parking lot and campsite."
Golden Ears,4.5,Ridge Meadows,Difficult,12.0,24.0,July - September,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/golden-ears/,"A free day-use pass is required for all hiking trails in Golden Ears Provincial Park fromMay 16 to September 1, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. The Golden Ears Trail is a popular hike in Golden Ears Provincial Park and offers some spectacular views for those who accomplish this challenging trail. It can be completed in a day but many people also enjoy the hike while camping. The trail is long and becomes increasingly steep as it progresses with much of the elevation gain occurring past the midway point. Make sure to leave early enough to have ample time during daylight hours if you plan to complete this hike in a day. There are a few things to be aware of before attempting the Golden Ears Trail. First, Golden Ears Park is open from 7 am to 11 pm so if you intend to complete this hike in a day without camping or being locked behind the gate in the park then you must start early.  Secondly, the West Canyon parking lot, where the hike begins, can fill up fast in the morning during peak season. Thirdly, you will need durable hiking footwear with good grip and good ankle support for this trail as it is very rocky throughout and slippery in several spots. Finally, the temperature at the top can be considerably cooler, even on hot summer days, so pack a light jacket or something to throw on to keep yourself warm. The trail to Golden Ears begins in the West Canyon parking lot. There is an outhouse, garbage bin, recycling bin, and a tap designated for drinking water only. From here, enter the trail past the West Canyon/Golden Ears sign. The hike will begin along the West Canyon Trail before it becomes the Golden Ears Trail. You will pass a green silo on the right and a junction for Menzies Trail. As you continue you will pass another junction connecting to Menzies Trail on the left.  You will also pass a junction for View Point Trail on the left but continue going straight, past these, along the West Canyon Trail. Continuing along the West Canyon Trail the terrain is rocky and mostly in tree cover.  Look for orange and pink markers to keep you on the trail.  You will cross over a few bridges early in the hike.  There is a fork in the trail to Lower Falls with an orange marker labeled ""3.11"" fixed to a narrow tree stump.  Keep left along the trail to get to the Golden Ears Trail. Continuing into the forest, the trail will become steeper and rockier as you walk over exposed tree roots.  Eventually you will get to the Gold Creek Lookout. There is a viewpoint just before you head down a short but very steep section to a roped area and the Gold Creek Lookout sign. Continuing along the trail you will pass a very large boulder in the forest. The trail will also pass many small bridges that are missing some planks so be very careful while crossing them. The trail eventually arrives at the Alder Flats campsite, which is a popular campsite for hikers that do the trek to Golden Ears in more than one day. After passing the campsite on the left, you will pass by an outhouse and eventually see a sign pointing to Golden Ears.  The trail becomes noticeably steeper and rockier from here as it leads to the first stunning viewpoint of Alouette Mountain, Blanshard Needle, Edge Peak, and Golden Ears. The trail continues into the forest and leads to a spot where there is a tree log in the trail with a section cut out of it to walk through and a fallen tree at an angle that you will pass under.  You should also notice a few nicely cut out blocks of wood along the trail.  Take note that you will shortly enter a clearing where you must note a junction in the trail that may not appear obvious. Before entering the clearing the trail will pass between two trees that are both wrapped with two orange ribbons on each. The trail will open to a rocky clearing.  There will be a path straight ahead that appears to be the continuation of the trail.Do not follow this trail.It is marked with pink ribbons labeled ""search and rescue"" and will lead through extremely dangerous terrain.  Instead, look to the right and you should notice several orange markers leading to a wooden staircase slightly hidden in the trees at the top of the rocks. This is the way to continue along the Golden Ears Trail. Also, this clearing has a nice view of Alouette Mountain, Blanshard Needle, Edge Peak, and Golden Ears. Ascending the staircases the trail becomes much steeper from this point forward. The staircases only assist you for a very short distance before you will need to frequently negotiate the terrain. Also, keep focused on following the markers as it can be easy to lose the trail in some areas. Most of the markers are orange but you will spot the occasional pink, yellow, and blue markers as well. The trail will be less rocky but have many exposed tree roots throughout. Along the way, you will need to climb up several steep rocks. They will tend to be slippery and you will have to be very cautious through these sections. The trail eventually comes to a viewpoint and will continue to a camping area.  Constantly be on lookout for trail markers as it's easy to become disorientated, lose the trail, and become lost yourself. Following this path and continuing along the markers will lead you to the top of a big wooden ladder against a rock. Climb down the ladder and continue along the trail. Eventually you will come to a large rock field. Following the markers will lead to the emergency shelter before the permanent snowfield.  On a clear day this challenging trail rewards hikers with fantastic views of Pitt Lake and the surrounding mountain ranges. Continuing past the emergency shelter to Panorama Ridge is not advised as it involves crossing a permanent snowfield and requires skill and proper equipment due to the steep and icy terrain. Also, due to the alpine environment, clouds can sweep in and obscure your ability to see far which can cause you to easily lose the trail and stray off course. Be mindful of leaving enough time for the return trip.  Heading back presents its own set of risks as you must now carefully descend the terrain on the way back. Remain focused on finding the markers and exercising caution while hiking the terrain. Fatigue from the steep climbing earlier can lead to injuries and making mistakes, causing you to go off course on the return trip.  When you return to the section with the wooden staircases be sure to go left at the rocky clearing to return through Alder Flats. Just before Alder Flats you will see a sign pointing to West Canyon Trail.  Remember to keep a sharp eye out for trail markers on the way back. Eventually, you will return past Gold Creek Lookout and end up on the West Canyon Trail leading back to the West Canyon parking lot."
Golden Ears Canyon Loop,4.5,Ridge Meadows,Intermediate,4.0,12.0,April - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/golden-ears-canyon-loop/,"A free day-use pass is required for all hiking trails in Golden Ears Provincial Park fromMay 16 to September 1, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. The completion of a bridge over Gold Creek in late-2015 connected the East Canyon and West Canyon trails and it's possible for hikers to do a loop through this area of Golden Ears Provincial Park. The route passes several points of interest, including Viewpoint Beach, Hikers Beach, and the Gold Creek Lookout. This trail is rated as Intermediate due to its length and one section of the route which is steep and rugged. Aside from this and despite being long, the majority of the route is fairly easy as it follows old logging roads which climb and descend gradually. Starting from the Gold Creek parking lot, walk to the far end and look for the signs to the East Canyon Trail (this is not the same trail as the one to Gold Creek Falls). Follow the trail as it briefly climbs, then go left onto another trail and head away from the parking lot. Not too long after walking along the connector trail, you reach the East Canyon Trail. Go left and begin hiking into the backcountry. The East Canyon Trail was a road formerly used for logging operations, so it climbs gently and remnants of the days when industry was in the area can often be seen at the side of the trail. Continue following the route as it passes a small waterfall to the right and reaches a junction with the connector trail to Gold Creek Falls. Go straight and stay on the East Canyon Trail as it ascends briefly before descending and reaching the bridge over Gold Creek to your left. Before crossing the bridge, it's worth the time to continue further on the East Canyon Trail to Viewpoint Beach, a rocky beach along Gold Creek that's less than 1km further. From Viewpoint Beach, on a clear day, you can see Golden Ears and also Raven Peak. It's also a nice location to step for a snack and enjoy the creek during the summer months. Hikers Beach is located on the other side of the creek and, once you hike back to the bridge and cross, the trail will go to a junction with a trail that takes you to that beach. After enjoying Viewpoint Beach, hike back down the East Canyon Trail to the bridge. Cross over the bridge and enjoy the views of Gold Creek rushing below before following the trail on the other side. Not too long after crossing the bridge, you reach a junction and going right takes you to Hikers Beach. This is also a great side trip if you have time but there is a creek crossing just after the junction that is only passible during the summer or early fall season, depending on the rain and weather. Continue the loop by leaving the junction and heading up the steep hill towards the West Canyon Trail. The trail climbs steeply and this next section is the most challenging of the entire route. Go left onto the West Canyon Trail to begin hiking back towards the parking lot areas. This section of trail is quite rugged, with lots of rocks and roots to step over so be sure to use caution and take your time hiking through this area. The West Canyon Trail passes the Gold Creek Lookout, marked by an old wooden sign on a tree, offering a view of the creek below and the bridge that you crossed earlier. After enjoying the view, carefully walk up the wooden steps and continue through the forest along the West Canyon Trail as it starts to descend. Watch for a sign to your left marking a trail that goes to the Gold Creek Falls Viewpoint.  If you have extra energy and don't mind hiking down a steep hill and then back up again, this view of Gold Creek Falls is spectacular as you see it from an angle looking straight on. Follow the orange markers on the trees as the trail descends steeply, making its way down some old, slippery wooden planks, before reaching the bottom. Go right and then look for an opening in the trees offering a view. There is no specific marked view, so you will have to find the best view as you peer through the trees. After enjoying the view, follow the orange markers and hike back up the steep hill to the West Canyon Trail. From the junction of the Gold Creek Falls Viewpoint back to the start, the hikes is fairly easy but long. Follow the West Canyon Trail as it makes its way through the forest, passing over a couple of bridges and past the junction to the Viewpoint Trail. Not much further and you reach a water tower on your left and the junction to the Menzies Trail. Go left onto the Menzies Trail (if you reach the West Canyon parking lot, you've gone too far and will need to walk back to the Menzies Trail) and follow it for the next 10-minutes until it descends through a switchback and finishes at the road near the one-way bridge you drove across earlier. Walk across the bridge towards the parking lot where you started your hike."
Goldie Lake,3.3,The North Shore,Easy,2.0,3.0,June - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/goldie-lake/,"Located on top of Mount Seymour in a scenic forest setting, the trails to Goldie Lake offer a great outdoor hike that is perfect for families to explore. From the parking area at Mount Seymour, walk to the BC Parks signboard at the far end and orientate yourself with the trails to Goldie and Flower Lakes. Once you have studied the map, walk back towards where the Goldie Rope Tow towers stand, without rope, during the summer season. Walk down the hill, continuing in a straight path, to where the trail enters the forest and continue along the trail to Goldie Lake. Not long after leaving the ski area you reach a junction that connects to the Flower Lake Loop. Continue along the trail to the left towards Goldie Lake as you enjoy the peaceful surroundings and the occasional sounds of birds in the trees. The trail weaves its way through the forest before reaching a second junction. Go left to start the loop around Goldie Lake. After walking a few minutes, the trail opens up to a scenic view of Goldie Lake nestled between the rocks and forest. Continue following the trail as it climbs a small hill at the far end of the lake, before descending and crossing a bridge, and following alongside the rocky mountain side. Pick your area to stop and have lunch. Or, to get to the section on the west side of the lake that looks as though its an island, continue around the loop and go right at the first junction before taking another right and walking out onto the gravel area. After enjoying Goldie Lake, you can either return via the route you arrived to the Mount Seymour Parking area or you can extend your hike to do the Flower Lake Loop. To reach the Flower Lake Loop, walk south to the 4-way junction that sits between too small, unnamed lakes. Check the sign for the directions to Flower Lake and take the route that passes one of the small lakes on your left. This trail is a little less used then the others and can be muddy after a rainfall or in the spring. Weave your way through the forest until you reach Flower Lake on your right. At the far end of Flower Lake, you can choose to exit the forest to where the ski lifts are, however you will have to hike back up the hill in the ski area. A nicer option is to go right and loop around the entire lake, returning to the junction that connects Flower Lake Loop to the Goldie Lake Trail. Go left at this junction and a few hundred meters later, you reach the junction with the Goldie Lake trail where going left will return you to the parking area."
Greenburn Lake,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Intermediate,1.25,3.1,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/greenburn-lake/,"Greenburn Lake is located on south Pender Island and is part of the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. The trail begins next to the Firehall and loops around the lake, providing hikers with scenic views and the occasional glimpse of beavers swimming in the lake. The trail on the north side of Greenburn Lake is very rugged and difficult to follow at times. This is the reason for a ""intermediate"" rating as hikers who do the south side trail are often surprised at the challenging terrain of the north side and lack of any trail markers. The trail begins on a wide gravel access road next to the South Pender Island Firehall. Walk past the gate and follow the route as it gently climbs uphill, making its way into the forest. The gravel road will begin to level and curve slightly just before approaching Greenburn Lake. When the lake comes into view, walk down the hill to the right towards the dam. This will be the beginning of walking the lake loop in a counter-clockwise direction. Enjoy the view of the lake from the dam, then begin following the trail around the lake. The trail on the south side of Greenburn Lake weaves its way through lush forest, going up and over small hills. There are not many views of the lake but the forest is beautiful and the trail is easy to follow, even though it's clearly not hiked as often as other trails. At the far end of the lake, the trail veers left and descends slightly before reaching a point where you get a view of the lake. From the end of the lake, the hike back is a lot more challenging along the north side as there are several fallen trees to climb over and large boulders to climb up and down where you will have to use your hands for assistance. There are no trail markers, making the route difficult to follow, however there are sections of worn path between the boulders and as long as you stay relatively close to the lake, you will have no problems making your way at a much slower page back. The north side of the lake also offers a few views as well, since the trail is closer to the lake. During the evenings, beavers can often be spotted swimming in the lake before slapping their tails on the water in the hope that they are scaring you off. After making your way through the difficult terrain, the trail reaches a nice smooth dirt section and then slowly inclines, passing between one bushes and reaching the clearing back near the dam where you began your loop. Leave Greenburn Lake by following the gravel access road as it curves around before descending back downhill to the gate by the firehall where you began."
Grouse Grind,4.2,The North Shore,Difficult,1.5,2.9,June - September,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/grouse-grind/,"Updated April 25, 2025- The Grouse Grind is open daily from 7:00am - 6:30pm. The Grouse Grind is Vancouver's most used trail and is renowned for its challenge in requiring physical strength and endurance in order to make it to the top. In less than 3km, the trail climbs more than 850m. Due to the large number of people that use this trail, primarily for exercise, maintenance workers have had to build wooden stairs on much of the path in order to prevent further erosion from overuse. The trail begins just east (right) of the Grouse Mountain Gondola in an area with posts set up for hikers to use for stretching their arms and legs before the hike. Walk past the gate and over the small bridge and immediately begin your uphill ascent. The trail levels out until you reach a sign at a fork in the trail. Go left at the fork and continue your uphill climb making your way over rocks, roots, and wooden steps. After 15 minutes or so, you cross a small bridge over a dried-up creek. It's only another 10 minutes to the first quarter mark. Each quarter mark is clearly shown with large signs and can be a relief or an indication on whether to continue or not. If you are struggling at the first quarter mark or have run out of water, it's probably a better idea to walk back down as there is still a long, grueling way to go and you could potentially run into some serious problems if you choose to continue. For those continuing, the trail weaves its way uphill over more wooden steps. The third quarter is the steepest with the trail traversing over rock in some sections. The fourth quarter is also quite steep with some sections containing very large steps. Keep going, you're almost there. Once at the top, you have earned bragging rights by saying you have completed 'The Grind'. Walk towards the Grouse Mountain Chalet and up the stairs to the entrance. Just inside, you can buy your ticket for the Gondola ride before heading back down, have a beer at the bar, or wander around the top of Grouse Mountain to check out the events or scenery."
Hanes Valley Trail,4.4,The North Shore,Difficult,8.5,16.0,July - September,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hanes-valley-trail/,"The Hanes Valley Trail and all other backcountry trails in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park are nowclosedfor the season. The trail will re-open in roughly July 2025, or when the snow and conditions allow. The Hanes Valley Trail is a very difficult hiking route that starts from the Lynn Creek crossing in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park and ends on top of Grouse Mountain. What makes this backcountry route so difficult is the extremely steep boulder field that hikers must scramble up, using their hands and feet. The views of the valley are quite scenic though and the trail also passes several other points of interest, including Norvan Falls and viewpoints of Crown and Goat Mountains. A few things to know before you hike the Hanes Valley Trail, one is that the route starts at one end of North Vancouver and ends at a completely different location. That means trip planning, prior to starting the hike, should be done to make sure proper transportation has been arranged at the end of the hike. Secondly, this hike is meant for experienced hikers and those who are in very good physical condition. This is one of the areas where North Shore Rescue spends too much time rescuing ill-prepared hikers, so make sure you are up for the long trek and steep climb through the backcountry terrain. Thirdly, make sure to hike this trail when it's free of snow as hiking up the boulder field is extremely dangerous without proper equipment when there is snow. Even in the summer months, snow can linger to well into July. Lastly, remember to bring money ($10 as of 2013) to pay for the Grouse Mountain Skyride. The trail starts from the parking lot at the end of Lynn Valley Road in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park. Follow the trail across the bridge to a large signboard with a map of the area. Since this is a backcountry hike, it's a good idea to register at the board by dropping one part of the form into the dropbox and taking the small attached slip of paper with you so you can phone the number later to let Metro Vancouver know you have completed the trail safely. Once you've done this, go left and following the wide trail next to Lynn Creek. It's a good idea to hike the first section at a fairly moderate pace as it's relatively easy and important to make good time at the beginning. The wide trail continues for sometime as you pass a junction where the Lynn Loop trail joins this route. Continue along the wooden bridge as the trail begins to narrow and goes through a forest of small trees. After hiking more than an hour, the trail reaches a clearing known as the 3rd Debris Chute. The mountain viewed on the left is Mount Fromme. The trail continues up the debris chute at a junction, where you will go left towards Norvan Falls. After pass the 3rd Debris Chute, the trail becomes noticeably quieter and free of most dog-walkers. The path also becomes narrower and much more rocky and rugged as you find yourself dropping down into creek beds and hiking back out the other side. Continue hiking at a decent page as the trail passes through the forest and eventually reaches a junction for Coliseum Mountain. Pass the junction and a few steps further, another junction for Norvan Falls, where a short trail to your right takes you up for a scenic, worthwhile view of the falls. After viewing the waterfall, walk back to the main trail and cross the metal suspension bridge. This is the point that you are officially entering the backcountry and the trails beyond this point are not hiked as often as the previous trails. Therefore, it's important to watch for trail markers on trees and rocks and not stray too far without seeing one as it's easy to lose the trail and become lost. Follow the rugged trail as it makes its way through the second generation growth forest. The route continues its gradual uphill climb but nothing too strenuous up until now. Eventually, you reach another junction marked by a sign with map of the area. Going right takes you to Lynn Lake, however you want to go left and down the steep hill to follow the Hanes Valley route. After hiking down the steep hill, you reach Upper Lynn Creek. There is some rocks and trees that have built up that are used as a crossing but be very careful as it's easy to lose your footing on the slippery rocks and you're a long ways into your hike. After crossing the creek, continue following the trail and make sure to pay attention for trail markers on trees. The vegetation through this section of trail is a bit more open and sometimes the trail is not obvious but the markers on trees are in good condition and easy to follow when you look for them. There are a few steeper sections in this part of the trail, however nothing too bad compared to what lies ahead. Eventually, you will cross another creek bed that's dry in the later summer months. Look for the flagging on the other side and continue your hike along the trail. The trail starts to offer the occasional glimpse of the surrounding mountains. After crossing a small creek, the trail reaches a clearing, next to a storage box and a helicopter pad on the left, with a view of the boulder field in Hanes Valley. It's an incredible, breathtaking view look up the rocks towards the top and that's exactly where you will be hiking. The distance to the top of the boulder field is about 1.5km and the elevation gain is more than 500 meters! The first section beyond the helicopter pad continues along a trail, up a very steep section. Then the trail ends and you are among he rocks. The route is generally well marked with flagging tape, so plan your footsteps over the rocks so you go from one marking to the next. The rocks seem like they go on forever and, while it seemed like you were making good time, this section of the trail takes most people over an hour. Don't forget to stop and look back down as the views back down the Hanes Valley are incredible. Eventually, you reach the end of the boulder field and enter amongst some trees, however this trail continues at a very steep rate. A couple of switch backs later, the trail begins to level and you reach the junction with the Crown Mountain trail. At the Crown Mountain, go left towards the Goat Mountain trail and eventually Grouse Mountain. The next section starts out quite easy as you cross a small, open rock slide area. However, things change fast as the uphill section begins. The steep trail is very rough and often muddy as little sunlight reaches this area of trail that is hidden behind several mountains and deep amongst the vegetation. Continue your uphill climb until you reach a series of chains that are bolted into the rocks. Use these chains to help you get up the steep, slippery rocks. The trail continues uphill until it finally reaches a rocky bluff with a view of Crown Mountain on a clear day. A few steps beyond this viewpoint, the trail meets with the Goat Mountain Trail. Go right up a small hill and from this point forward, the hike should be much easier from the sections you have completed. The trail passes a couple of junctions, including Little Goat Mountain and Dam Mountain, but keeping following the trail markings towards Grouse Mountain. The trail eventually reaches a Zipline platform, a popular tourist attraction in the summer. Go right and follow the trail down hill below the Zipline platform. Not much further and the trail widens and turns into an old service road. Follow this road as you can now see the Grouse Mountain chalet in view. Pass the grizzly bear enclosure and follow the paved routes towards the Skyride."
Harrison Grind,4.2,Fraser Valley East,Difficult,6.0,7.0,March - November,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/harrison-grind/,"Harrison Lake's answer to the Grouse Grind is a route that climbs up the side of a steep mountain along the Campbell Lake trail and offers a great view of Harrison Lake at the top. The route is rugged and passes through sections that are overgrown, blowdown that's challenging to climb over, and parts of the trail that have become a creek. This hike is not for the inexperienced. The trailhead is located on a gravel section off to the side of the main Hot Springs Road by Balsam Avenue. Walk through the small opening in the chain-linked fence as the gravel road veers to the right, followed by a left and a very steep incline. At the top of the hill sit a couple of large water tanks and a concrete viewing platform to the left where you can catch your breath. Continue on the far side of the tanks as the trail enters the forest and follows a rough, rocky path uphill. The path serves as a creek bed, so watch your footing as the rocks can be slippery. About 15 minutes up the trail, the trail veers to the right and opens up underneath the power lines with a large rocky outcrop on the left. This section of trail can be fairly overgrown with the bushes encroaching on the path. Continue hiking up the path until you are next to a powerline tower, then look to your right to see a view back towards the Fraser Valley. Right after the power line tower, the trail veers to the left and enters back into the forest. After the roughness of the previous section, the next section is fairly enjoyable as the trail weaves through switchbacks through the coastal mountain forest, crossing small creeks and the occasional blowdown. However, the trail gets steeper and drags on as you continue making your way towards the top. Eventually you cross an old. narrow bridge made out of a log. Be careful is this is often slippery. Not too much further and the trail begins to open up onto a rocky section with a view of Harrison Lake. The view of Harrison Lake is the final destination for the Harrison Grind, however the trail does continue to Campbell Lake which is about 40 minutes away and through fairly flat terrain. Once you've enjoyed the view, head back down the trail the same route that you arrived, carefully stepping over the blowdown and be extra cautious along the rocks under the power lines."
Hayward Lake,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,5.5,17.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hayward-lake/,"Located north of Mission, BC, Hayward Lake offers a scenic hike along the trails maintained by BC Hydro. The lake has two trails; the Railway Trail on the west side and the Reservoir Trail on the east side. The Railway Trail along the west side of Hayward Lake is a fairly flat and wide trail as it once served as the railway line that connected the Stave Lake Reservoir to the town of Mission. The trail is 12km and takes 3.5 hours to complete to Ruskin Dam and back. From the Hayward Lake Recreation Area parking lot, walk towards the lake, passing the washrooms and follow the paved trail as it becomes gravel. Just as you leave the recreation area, on the right of the trail is the scenic Beaver Pond. Continue south on the trail as you catch occasional glimpses of the lake before reaching a viewpoint. The trail veers into the forest just as old wooden pillars from trestle bridges can be seen still standing from the lake. The trail narrows and crosses several bridges and walkways before emerging back alongside the lake on the former railway route. Continue south, passing a small beach and eventually arriving at a parking lot. A few hundred meters beyond the parking lot is Ruskin Dam. After checking out the dam, retrace your footsteps north back towards the Hayward Lake Recreation Area parking lot. Alternatively, if Ruskin Dam is not closed, you can cross the dam and walk along the Reservoir Trail that starts at the yellow gate and follows the eastern shore of Hayward Lake. The Reservoir Trail is 17km (5.5 hours long) round trip trail that passes through thick, lush forest covered in sheets of moss. To reach the trail from the Hayward Lake Recreation Area parking lot, walk towards the washrooms and veer to the left onto a path. After a short distance, the path crosses a wooden bridge and continues up a paved area to the Stave Falls Dam and Powerhouse. Cross the dam, staying on the edge to avoid traffic. Once across, stay on the right side of the fence as the trail begins to ascend a steep series of switchbacks before reaching the top where there is a view of the valley below. Continue along the trail and about 10 minutes later, you arrive at a sign to Steelhead Falls. Go right for this short detour and follow the path as it heads downhill and through a short set of wooden steps before arriving at a view of the waterfall. After walking back up the hill to the main trail from Steelhead Falls, go right and continue heading south. The trail meanders through lush green forests and across wooden bridges carpeted with moss. The trail eventually reaches a junction that leads down to a canoe launch and a small dock. The short side trip is worth it as the small dock offers a nice view of Hayward Lake. Back on the main trail, continue your hike heading south as the trail begins to descend. After a downhill section, cross the floating bridge and walk up the other side. A short distance later, the trail exits the forest onto a wider gravel road. Continue down the gravel road towards the yellow gate where Ruskin Dam is located off to the right. At this point, retrace your steps north towards Stave Lake Reservoir and back across to where you parked. Alternatively, if Ruskin Dam is not closed, you can cross the dam and return via the Railway Trail on the west side of the lake."
Helm Lake,4.7,Whistler,Difficult,9.0,26.0,July - October,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/helm-lake/,"A free day-use pass is required daily from the Cheakamus Lake trailhead from April 25, 2025 - September 1, 2025. From September 2, 2025 - October 13, 2025, a day-use pass is required on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. The hike to Helm Lake begins from the Cheakamus Lake parking lot area and climbs steeply before reaching the Helm Creek campsite and passing through the alpine area of Garibaldi Provincial Park. The route has incredible views of Black Tusk, Cinder Cone, and much more and is popular with campers wanting to stay overnight to explore some of the longer hikes. Follow the trail at the end of the parking lot towards Cheakamus Lake as you leave the open area and enter the forest. The first 1.5km follows the trail to Cheakamus Lake until you reach the junction to Helm Lake. The route is relatively easy to begin and passes through a scenic forest. From the junction, it's about 7.5km to the Helm Creek campground. Go right and walk down the hill as the trail veers left and then back to the right before reaching a metal bridge that crosses Cheakamus Lake. After crossing the bridge, the trail climbs very steeply through a series of switchbacks. The trail is well maintained but the climb is relentless as you gain more than 300-meters in elevation quickly. When you reach a clearing on your left where there are benches made out of fallen logs, this rest stop signals the end of the really steep section of the hike. Continue hiking uphill as the trail is now much more gradual but continues through the forested area. The rushing water of Helm Creek can be heard to the right but there are only a couple of glimpses along the route where you can see the creek. After hiking for more than an hour, you get the first hint that you are approaching the campsite after crossing a small wooden bridge over a creek. About another 15 - 20 minutes further and the trail reaches a meadow at the Helm Creek campsite where Black Tusk towers high above in the backdrop. Pass through the campsite and continue straight along the trail for the next 4km to Helm Lake. The trail continues to climb gradually and there are fewer trees around with more magnificent views of the area. To the right is the incredible looking Black Tusk and to the right is a mountain known as Cinder Cone. The trail reaches a lake that is sometimes confused as Helm Lake. Pass the lake with an unknown name and continue along the edges as the trail now follows a rocky route marked by posts with trail markers. When you reach a river, go left and follow the markers along the river a short distance to where there is a bridge crossing. Cross over the raised bridge, then follow the river back down before veering left and heading towards Helm Lake. The lake can be seen across the rocks and appears to be hovering on the rocks just below Black Tusk. The best view of Helm Lake is along the trail, continuing past the lake and up the rocky hill. Find a place to sit and enjoy the view looking back across the valley where you hiked. Just a short 10-minute hike beyond Helm Lake brings you to the Panorama Ridge junction, where you can decide to do a much longer hike to eitherPanorama Ridge,Black Tusk,Garibaldi Lake, or the traverse to the Rubble Creek parking lot. While it's usually common to camp overnight and do these longer hikes the next day, it's possible to hike to Panorama Ridge but makes for a very strenuous and long day of hiking. After enjoying the views, retrace your steps, walking back towards the river and crossing the bridge upstream, before heading back through the alpine area towards the Helm Creek campsite. Take your time and enjoy the incredible scenery and views as you make your way gradually downhill. After passing through the campsite, begin the long trek through the forest back downhill towards the Cheakamus River. Pace yourself and your legs and prepare yourself for the steep switchbacks after passing the rest area. Cross the Cheakamus River and walk up the trail to the junction that joins with the Cheakamus Lake trail. Go left and walk the final 1.5km back to the parking lot."
Hicks Lake,2.2,Fraser Valley East,Easy,2.0,6.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hicks-lake/,"The hiking trail around Hicks Lake in Sasquatch Provincial Park offers a nice, peaceful loop that passes along the lake shores, over several small streams, and returns via a gravel road. The route offers a few scenic viewpoints of the lake and joins several of the picnic, beach, and campsite areas. From the boat launch in the day-use area, the trail starts on the right from the sandy beach. Follow the trail as it weaves along the shoreline. A short distance along the route, the trail opens next to a rocky outcrop that overlooks a scenic view of the lake. After a quick stop, walk back onto the trail and continue as it makes its way down to one of the picnic beach area. After passing over a metal bridge, immediately go left and follow the route along the lake beach. It may look like the trail goes to the right but that route just goes to the campsite area. Continue along the trail as it weaves through the forest and arrives at another picnic area. This time, the trail enters back into the forest just up from the beach area. This is the last picnic area as you begin to walk away from the camping area. The next section of trail makes its way through the forest, with short uphill and downhill sections, small bridges crossing streams, and the occasional glimpses of Hicks Lake. It's a scenic section of trail that can often be a bit muddy during the winter months. There are more than a dozen small wooden bridges and in the late spring, most of these creeks are rushing with water from the melting snow on the nearby mountains. The trail eventually ends up joining a gravel road. At this point, the decision can be made to walk along the gravel road to loop back to the start or return to the day-use area along the same trail you arrived by. The gravel road does not offer many scenic points but is a quicker route due to its flatness, despite having to loop around more than half the lake still. If returning via the gravel road, note that the kilometre markers refer to the turnoff to Hicks Lake and not to the start of the hiking trail. You can expect that the parking lot will end up around the 2.5km mark at the day-use area where you started."
Hidden Grove,4.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,1.5,3.5,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hidden-grove/,"Hidden Grove is a beautiful forested area with a network of hiking trails that pass by several enormous Douglas Fir trees. Located just north of Sechelt, the many different paths offer a unique opportunity to plan your route through a lush west coast forest, on routes that are well maintained. There are many trails throughout the park and the areas is extremely well marked, with maps at all junctions and coloured markers marking the corresponding coloured trails on all maps. The route described here begins from the parking lot area and then follows a route that passes by all of the large trees on the east side of Inlet Road. The route also follows the yellow trail to the top of the park's highpoint. While the trail description seems a bit confusing with the mention of the different trail colours, it's quite easy to follow and the maps at all junctions in the park really help. From the map kiosk next to the parking lot area, follow the blue trail to the left (the blue trail also goes to the right but take the one to the left) Within seconds, you pass the olive green trail but continue along the blue trail. At a junction with the green trail, go left and follow it up the small hill as it passes another junction before veering to the left and up between some rocky areas. As you ascend through the rocky area, look to your right for the first large tree called the Sentinel. The tree is not right next to the trail, so it's easy to miss if you're not looking. After passing the Sentinel, continue up the trail, staying on the green trail until you reach the junction with the pink trail on the left. Go left and follow the pink trail as it meanders through beautiful forest, covered in moss. Stay on the pink trail by going straight through the 4-way junction. As you approach another 4-way junction, a giant tree sits next to the trail, this tree known as the Lonely Giant. Go right at the Lonely Giant and then immediately go left so that you're taking the bright green trail to the left. Follow this short section and when the trail begins to descend, looking for the large tree on the left that is unnamed and continue to the trail junctions at the bottom where there is another big tree next to the Ancient Grove. At this point, you have to decide whether to hike up to the high point on the yellow trail. The yellow trail is fairly steep and the viewpoint is mediocre as the trees are beginning to cover a large portion of what used to be a view. To hike up to the viewpoint, follow the blue trail to the right for a few steps to a junction on the left and then take the yellow trail. Follow the yellow trail as it passes junctions with the red trail, continuing through the forest before it starts to climb steeply. The route ascends over well placed, rocky steps before reaching a junction where you can go to the high point to the right or the better viewpoint to the left. Go left and walk a bit further to a wooden bench perched on a rocky outcrop where there is a view peaking through the trees. After, follow the yellow trail as it descends from the other side, watching your step as you continue downhill. Eventually, the trail rejoins the blue trail. If you would like to end your hike early, follow the blue trail to the right and it will take you back down to the parking lot area. To continue to the other big trees, go left on the blue trail and walk a short distance back to where you were earlier when you started the yellow trail. This time, continue past these junctions staying on the blue trail until it meets the red trail. Go right onto the red trail and continue through the forest as you quickly make time before reaching another junction. Make sure to go left at this junction so you stay on the red trail. This stretch of the red trail is fairly long but the forest is beautiful as you pass through an area of the park known as Maple Grove. When the trail eventually reaches a junction, go left onto the dark green trail and follow this, passing straight through a 4-way junction and continuing on the dark green route. The trail continues to meander until it reaches another big tree on the left known as the Twister. After enjoying this tree, walk a bit further and go left at the junction, continuing on the dark green trail. When you reach yet another junction, go left onto the red trail and just a few steps further, you reach the final big tree in this section of the park known as the Leaning Giant. Begin the route back to the parking lot by following the red trail and staying on the red trail as you pass a junction with the light blue trail. At another junction with a connector trail, go left and continue on the red trail, again passing the light blue trail. The red trail continues as you gradually gain elevation through this section before, eventually reaching a junction with the olive green trail. Go right onto the olive green trail and continue gradually gaining elevation as you pass the hill to the left. The olive green trail continues and begins to descend to where it meets the blue trail. Go straight at the blue trail, downhill, and within a few minutes, you return to the parking lot area."
High Falls Creek,3.8,Howe Sound,Intermediate,5.0,12.0,May - October,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/high-falls-creek/,"With a stunning waterfall and several gorgeous views of the Squamish Valley and Tantalus Range, High Falls Creek is one of the most scenic hikes in the area. High Falls Creek can be a dangerous hike for those that do not use caution or are afraid of heights. It is tempting to want to stick ones head out over the edge of the trail in an attempt to see the bottom of the falls. However, in doing so, you risk slipping and falling dozens of meters below and causing severe injuries or even death. It has been documented that a few experienced hikers have lost their lives on this trail. Therefore it is important to keep safety in mind and use extreme caution. From the parking area, walk across the bridge and continue a short distance on the gravel road until you reach a sign and trail markers that mark the route to High Falls on the right. Follow this trail and enter into the forest. The sound of High Creek can be heard through the trees. A short distance and you arrive at a large rock at which point the uphill climb begins. Use your hands and legs to scramble up and over the rocks to a viewpoint just above. This view is just a glimpse of what's to come as the view at higher elevations is much nicer. Continue the uphill trek as you make your way over rocks while keeping an eye out for the coloured trail markers. After using the ropes along the trail to pull yourself up through the steep sections, a short side path leads to a view of the falls and the steep canyon wall on the opposite side. Take in the view while being careful not to get too close to the edge. Head back onto the main trail as it continues to climb steeply for another 20 minutes or so until you arrive at a full view of the falls. The large boulder wedged between the granite rock walls carved out over hundreds of years makes for a truly spectacular photo. As you continue, it seems as though the steep unrelenting trail will never end. A short distance up, the trail opens onto a rocky bluff with a stunning view of the Squamish Valley. The Squamish River below weaves through the valley while the glacier-covered slopes of the Tantalus Range stand tall behind. After soaking in the view, continue back along the trail. The trail passes into a small forest before reaching a junction. Go right at the junction and walk a short distance downhill to a view of the upper falls from above. Do not venture too close to the edge as the dirt can be loose and give way. After enjoying the view and cool mist from the falls, walk back up the trail to the junction and go straight as the trail continues up the hill. The trail continues until it reaches a ridge and begins to level. The steepest sections of the trail have past as you now can see several views of the Squamish River and Valley below. Continue following the trail as it passes through a forest of Douglas Fir and Western Cedar trees. As you continue your hike the trail weaves alongside steep cliffs and a thick forested area, then through a second-generation growth area that was logged in the 90's. Eventually, the trail reaches a boulder field. Scramble up and over the rocks to a gravel logging road above. From this point go left and walk up the gravel road to where the high point is just a short distance away. At the corner is a log bench overlooking a view of the Tantalus Range in the background. Continue along the gravel road as it slowly makes its way back down towards the valley. Enjoy several scenic views of the Squamish River as you go. After walking for just over 5km, the gravel road meets the Squamish Valley Road that runs next to the river. Go left and walk about 20 minutes back to where you started your hike."
High Note Trail,4.2,Whistler,Intermediate,4.0,9.5,July - October,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/high-note-trail/,"The High Note Trail offers the most scenic view of Cheakamus Lake in Garibaldi Provincial Park. The trail starts from the top of Whistler Mountain and wraps around the backside, offering dozens of incredible, mountaintop views before descending through the alpine area back to the Whistler Gondola.This trail requires that you take the Whistler Gondola and Peak Chairlift to the trailhead, which begins at the top of Whistler Mountain. Please note that there are height restrictions for the Whistler chairlift and children under the required height will not be allowed to ride on the chairlift for safety reasons. Check with Whistler / Blackcomb for the updated requirements.From the top of Whistler and after taking in all the views of the stunning mountains, start the trail on the nearby rocky outcrop as it immediately descends while continuing to offer scenic views at different angles looking south. The trail passes under a rope, which marks the boundary to Garibaldi Provincial Park, and continues downward. Watch your step as the dry dirt and lose gravel on the steep sections can cause you to easily lose your footing.Eventually, the trail crosses a gravel road, used by mountain bikers, and continues on the other side. The next section of trail is relatively flat and clings to the mountainside as  you walk high above, with views of the Cheakamus River below and Black Tusk and surrounding mountains across the valley. In early-August, the colourful sea of wild flowers are in bloom but you have to be quick with the timing because they do not last long.After walking for about 30 minutes and enjoying dozens of views, the trail reaches the Cheakamus Lake Lookout, the first viewpoint of the turquoise coloured lake below. Continue along the trail and a short distance later, you reach the junction with the Half Note Trail. The Half Note offers a shorter, but steep, route back to an access road that returns to the Gondola. Go right and continue your hike along the High Note Trail as it passes through a rocky section before the dirt path passes between the grassy mountainside high above Cheakamus Lake.There is one tricky section of the trail where you have to pull yourself up onto a rock and then carefully lower yourself onto a metal walkway while holding onto a rope. This should not be a problem for most hikers, however if you are hiking with children or anyone unsure of their footing on this, make sure to help them through this obstacle. After this, the trail continues its way along the mountain and eventually reaches a junction. You will go left at the junction to continue along the High Note Trail back towards the Gondola. The route to the right is known as Singing Pass and continues into Garibaldi Provincial Park towards Russet Lake.The trail passes through a fairly flat section before descending down an open, rocky area known as Sun Bowl. Nestled at the bottom of the bowl, surrounding by scenic alpine mountains, is the small Symphony Lake. After enjoying the views, continue hiking the trail as it passes alongside a large rock slide and up and over a pass before descending next to viewpoints of Blackcomb in the distance.The last section of the trail descends quickly as the terrain changes from rocky to the occasional trees. At the Harmony Meadows junction, go right and continue downhill towards Harmony lake. Go left at the junction next to the lake and stay on the boardwalks as you walk around the lake to the far side before starting the uphill section. After several hours of hiking downhill, the leg muscles will be challenged by this final uphill push, however it's relatively short and not too steep before the trail levels next to a snowmaking reservoir. Follow the trail back towards the Gondola as you complete the loop and return to where you began your adventure.

Hillkeep Regional Park,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,0.75,2.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hillkeep-regional-park/,"Hillkeep Regional Park is located on the top of Chilliwack Mountain and offers two sections, one that goes to a viewpoint overlooking the Fraser Valley and another that meanders through a meadow. The land comprising of Hillkeep Regional Park was generous donated by local residents, Pat and Paige Woodward and intended as a nature reserve that the public can also enjoy. Both the Viewpoint route and Meadow Loop route begin on separate trails from the cul-de-sac near the park map but are both short enough hikes that each can be completed. Starting with the viewpoint trail, follow the gravel road furthest from the map board past the metal gate as the wide route quickly enters the forested area. The gravel road weaves around a couple of short corners until, just a few minutes later, you see a sign post on the left next to some wooden stairs. Go left and walk up these stairs. The trail narrows as you climb the stairs before briefly levelling and then climbing again. Just a short distance further and you reach the wooden platform at the viewpoint. The view is obstructed in places by trees but you can still enjoy a fairly spectacular view looking across the valley towards the mountains surrounding Cultus Lake. Return to the parking area by following the trail back down the hill to the gravel road, before going right and back down the road, past the metal gate. The Meadow Loop begins next to the park map and follows a trail down a steep hill. Follow the trail, enjoying the occasional glimpse of the Fraser River between the trees to your right. There are a couple of junctions, which are shorter routes that cross the larger loop, however stay to the right and complete the full loop. After the second junction, the trail briefly climbs before veering left and descending down to the marshy pond. Pass the pond and watch for a sign where you will have to go right to continue the loop. Another short distance and go right at a second junction as the trail wanders amongst the trees before descending back to the original trail where you walked along earlier. Having completed the loop at this point, walk the short distance back up the hill to the parking area."
Hollyburn Mountain,4.1,The North Shore,Intermediate,3.5,7.0,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hollyburn-mountain/,"Hollyburn Mountain is the perfect hike to do when you only have half a day and want to escape into the wilderness. The peak offers a scenic view of sections of Vancouver, Burrard Inlet, and the Lions off in the distance. From the parking lot, walk past the BC Parks mapboard and veer left, following the uphill trail next to the power lines. As you stop to catch your breath, make sure to look back at the view of Vancouver and Georgia Strait below. After a steady 15-minute climb, the path levels out as you pass a Fourth Lake on your left. Watch for a sign and a warming hut used by the cross-country skiers in the winter. Turn left and follow the trail towards Hollyburn Mountain. As you continue your hike, you pass through meadows of bushes, some of which are full of berries in the late summer and early fall. Be sure to watch for bears as they typically fill up on these berries just ahead of the hibernation season. After walking through meadows for 20 minutes, a sign at a junction points the way to Hollyburn Mountain on the right. Go right and continue uphill for another 20 minutes as the trail weaves back and forth. At this junction, just a few steps to the right is a bench with a viewpoint of Grouse Mountain and the surrounding area in the distance.
After taking in the view, head back to the main trail and continue your hike uphill. After another 20 minutes, the trees begin to thin and you arrive at a rocky outcrop, signaling the peak of Hollyburn Mountain. Climb to the top of this rocky section to take in the views of Georgia Strait, the Gulf Islands, and Vancouver's westside. Behind you stand both peaks of the Lions off in the distance as well as Grouse Mountain to the right. After enjoying the view and fresh air, head back down towards the path that you arrived on following the trail downhill towards the meadows. The walk back seems to go much quicker than the one to the peak as you gradually make your way back towards the power line trail. At the warming hut, turn right and follow the trail next to the power lines back down towards the parking lot."
Homesite Caves Trail,2.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,0.75,1.5,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/homesite-caves-trail/,"The Homesite Caves Trails is a short hike, through a rugged forest that passes several caves that have formed from water that has carved out the limestone rock. The caves are small and very unstable, so it is not possible to go inside of them, however the trail is still an interesting hike to see how the creek has carved away the surrounding area. The trail is short and relatively easy, however the terrain is quite rugged in areas, including rocky sections that pass through the creek and several fallen trees to climb over. The start of the trail begins near a spur along the Forestry Service Road (FSR) and ends at the Homesite Creek Campsite. From the campsite, you can walk back down the same trail or you can walk through the campsite and walk back down the FSR. Starting from the trailhead about 1.6km up the FSR, walk into the forest and follow the trail as it meanders through the forest. The trail slightly descends and you have to carefully climb over a couple of fallen logs. As you walk, look for several caves to the left of the trail. The caves are usually at the bottom of some small hills, where a creek has worn a path through the forest, carving out the limestone. Some are well hidden behind rocks or trees that have fallen and block their entrances. The trail continues as you make your way through a small valley along the creek until you reach a junction, where a short trail goes to Homesite Creek and a scenic waterfall. After enjoying the view of the rushing water, walk back to the junction and follow the trail up the hill as it heads in a direction parallel to the creek. Another short trail branches off to the right to some smaller waterfalls as you can walk down to the edge of the creek. Returning to the trail, it goes up a short, steep hill and arrives at the campsite. This is the end of the trail and you can either return via the same trail you took or walk through the campsite to the front gate, then down the FSR back to where you parked."
Homesite Creek Falls,2.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,1.5,3.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/homesite-creek-falls/,"The Homesite Creek Falls trail is a forested set of trails just off to the side of the Sunshine Coast Highway north of Sechelt. The trails pass through a thick forest route and provide great views of the scenic Homesite Creek waterfall. There are two sections to the Homesite Creek Trails. The section south of the creek is known as the Falls Trail and also has a loop and trail that goes to Brooks Road (not shown on the map). The Falls Trail only has a view of the 3rd waterfall, known as Homesite Creek Falls, and it's the best view. The section north of the creek is called the Nature Trail and it passes a few viewpoints of all three waterfalls before doing a scenic forested loop through the park. Some people simply do the short walk on the Falls Trail to Homesite Creek Falls, whearas others will complete all of the trails in the park. For the best view of the Homesite Creek waterfall, follow the Falls Trail (to the south of the creek) for about 500m. Walk into the forest as the trail immediately veers right and follows a route that is parallel to the highway before heading to the right and deeper into the forest. The trail passes a junction that's part of the loop trail. Continue to the right for about another 100m and watch for a small trail on the right. Go right and follow that small trail towards the sound of the waterfall where a great view of Homesite Creek Falls appears. You can step right down onto the rocky shoreline for the best view. Be careful during the spring runoff or after a heavy rainfall as the water in the creek can be moving quite rapidly. The Nature Trail begins alongside the highway on the north side of the creek. All 3 waterfalls can be seen from the north trail and then a beautiful forested loop can be hiked through this section of the park. To get to the Nature Trail, walk along the highway past the Homesite Creek and a trail enters the forest right after walking over the creek. Follow the trail into the forest as it quickly leaves the highway behind and listen for the flow of waterfalls. The first waterfall is quite small and it's quite far from the trail. Continue walking and the trail lead right to the edge of the creek where the second waterfall is. This is also a small waterfall. The trail continues through the forest and eventually arrives at a sign marking the junction to the start of the loop. Instead, go left and down the hill for a view of the third waterfall, known as Homesite Creek Falls. The view is ok from this side but the better view is on the other side of the creek, which is accessed for the Falls Trail. Return to the sign at the junction and go left, starting your hike around the loop. Follow the trail through the lush forest as it passes over some fallen trees and past moss covered stumps. The trail gradually gains some elevation but it's not that difficult and, besides have to step over the odd fallen tree, you are able to move quite quickly. The trail loops around and exits into an open area, somewhat like a meadow. Follow the worn path and re-enter the forest near the other side. The path continues to weave its way through the trees, now descending downhill until you return to the sign at the junction. After finishing the loop, follow the trail back along Homesite Creek as you hike back towards the highway, returning to where you began."
Hope Lookout Trail,4.7,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,2.5,4.5,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hope-lookout-trail/,"The Hope Lookout Trail is a steep hiking route that begins next to Highway #1 and climbs to a rocky area that overlooks the town, offering an incredible view of the Fraser River and surround area. Sometimes referred to as Hope's Grouse Grind, the trail is a fairly steep climb and, after the beginning section, is mostly in the trees and sheltered from the hot summer sun. From the map kiosk, pass by the gate and follow the wide road uphill until it reaches a switchback, then veer right and continue uphill. Watch for a trail on your left that goes steep uphill and follow that trail. Do not continue straight through the fenced area towards the water tower as you will have missed where you need to turn left. Hike up the steep, open hill until the trail veers right and enters the forest. Continue ascending where the trail occasionally meets a mountain biking trail but stay on the hiking route. The trail reaches a junction next to a bench, go right and continue up the wooden stairs as you make your way through the beautiful forest. Not much further and you reach another junction with the Joan Greenway Trail. Go right to the Hope Lookout and follow the trail as it now begins to really gain elevation through a number of switchbacks and wooden stairs. Pass a viewpoint to the right that looks down towards the highway and the town of Hope before continuing up another set of wooden steps. Eventually, the trail exits the forest onto a rocky slide area where you start to see the view of Hope and the surrounding region. Continue following the well worn path out onto the rocks, passing a couple of benches until you reach one near the far end of the slide. This point offers the best view as you can see the Fraser River, the town of Hope, and the traffic passing by on the highways below. Once you have enjoyed the view, head back across the rocks and follow the trail into the forest, carefully descending. There are some loose dirt sections that can be slippery, so be mindful of your step."
Hunter Road Trail,4.4,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,3.0,8.0,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/hunter-road-trail/,"The Hunter Road Trail follows a forest service road and ends at a spectacular viewpoint looking north towards Stave Lake. Located in the Steelhead community of Mission, the hike is not too exciting but the view is well worth the effort. From the metal gate, follow the gravel road across the wooden bridge as it begins to climb steeply. Most of the elevation gain occurs in the 1st kilometre and the 4th kilometre with the middle section of the route being a little more level. Continue up the steep gravel road until you finally reach the top about 30-minutes later.The road passes a logged section before dropping slightly and continuing to a junction. There are 3 junctions and if you go left at all 3, you will reach the top. Go left at the first junction and continue your hike. The road continues where it reaches a 2nd junction. Go left again and, after a short section, the route begins to climb steeply again. Keep going until you reach a 3rd junction and go left again. The trail begins to level and makes one final veer to the left where it abruptly ends at the viewpoint. The view is spectacular as you are able to see quite far north looking up towards Stave Lake. After you have finished enjoying the view, following the gravel road back via the route you arrived. Make sure to go right at all of the junctions as you descend the steep sections and pass through the level section. After making the final descent and crossing the wooden bridge, you arrive back at the metal gate where you began."
Iceberg Lake,4.2,Whistler,Intermediate,7.0,15.0,July - September,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/iceberg-lake/,"The hike to Iceberg Lake near Whistler takes you high into the alpine, following the scenic forested trail near 19 Mile Creek before arriving at a beautiful meadow in the foreground of Rainbow Glacier. The trail then ascends a boulder field to Iceberg Lake next to Rainbow Mountain offering unprecedented views of the region. There are a few different routes to reach Iceberg Lake but the route described here follows the 19 Mile Creek Trails directly to the lake and returns the same route. The trails are a bit confusing along the lower section but staying on the Lower 19 Mile Creek Trail (sometime called the 19 Mile Creek East Trail) will take you to the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail, and once at the Upper trail, this trail goes straight to Iceberg Lake. Routes via the Skywalk North or South Trails can also be hiked to Iceberg Lake but are much longer and more difficult. From the cul-de-sac at the top of Mountain View Drive, walk past the wooden sign board and immediately turn left at a trail sign for Lower 19 Mile Creek. It's important to immediately turn left and see this trail sign and not continue past it. Follow the trail as it climbs uphill and reaches a gravel road. Go left and walk up the gravel road for about 40m and watch for a sign on the right of the road. Follow the trail to the right of the road as it goes up to another gravel logging road. Cross this second road and walk up the steep bank on the other side into the forest. After leaving the gravel road, the trail crosses a bridge and then begins to climb steeply. You will gain plenty of elevation along the Lower 19 Mile Creek section of the trail so make sure to pace yourself. The trail reaches a sign pointing to a viewpoint to the left, go left to see a view looking down towards Green Lake. Return to the trail and continue following it uphill. At a 4-way junction with a mountain biking trail, cross the mountain biking trail and continue straight. A short distance further, where the trail merges with a wide trail, go right and up the steep hill. The trail then goes left and arrives at a sign for the Screaming Cat Lake Connector, which is used to access the Skywalk North Loop. Instead, go left and continue to follow the Lower 19 Mile Creek Route. The trail continues its steep ascent until it reaches another junction. Go left and continue until, yet again, the route comes to another junction. Go left and follow the wider trail through a flat section, giving you a bit of a reprieve from the steep climb. After about 70m, watch for a white trail marker sign on your right for the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail. Go right onto the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail as this trail will take you all the way to Iceberg Lake. Follow the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail as it continues ascending but at a much gentler pace, passing through lush west coast forest and over small creeks and marshy areas. After hiking for just over 1km, you reach a junction with a trail called Kevin's Home Run Trail. This trail is a different route that goes north to an area just Northwest of Screaming Cat Lake, where the east end of the Skywalk North Trail begins. Go left at this junction, cross a bridge over 19 Mile Creek a short distance further, and continue following the Upper 19 Mile Creek route. The trail crosses several wooden bridges and follows close to 19 Mile Creek, offering a few views of small waterfalls as you hike towards the top. After more than an hour of hiking, the trail passes a junction with the Skywalk South Trail. Continue to the right as the trail begins to reach the alpine and opens up, offering an incredible view of the meadows in front of Rainbow Glacier. Timed right, the wild flowers will be in bloom and several waterfalls can be seen from the melting snow and ice falling from the mountains above. Hike along the trail, over a wooden bridge crossing 19 Mile Creek, and following an incredibly scenic route through the meadows. The trail reaches a large boulder field where it ascends to Iceberg Lake. Watch for trail markers and the worn path up the boulder field, carefully following the route and crossing a couple of small creeks during the early summer months. The trail makes its final ascent just above Iceberg Lake, where you can walk the short distance down to the edge of the lake or find a spot on the rocks above to soak in the views of the lake, glacier, and surrounding mountains. After enjoying the scenery, return to the trail just above the lake, and follow it down the rocks, carefully watch your step while you enjoy the views looking down towards Whistler Village, across the meadow, and up toward the glacier behind you. Take your time through the meadows as you admire the views from different angles before leaving the alpine and following the trail back into the forest. Go left at the junction with the Skyline South Trail and follow the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail back downhill. The route is well defined as you move quickly downhill, eventually crossing the bridge over 19 Mile Creek, passing the junction with Kevin's Home Run Trail and continue down to the end of the Upper 19 Mile Creek section of the route. Go left and then make a right onto the Lower 19 Mile Creek Trail as you continue to follow the signs. Pass the junction with the Screaming Cat Lake Connector Trail and then follow the wide trail down the steep hill, making sure to go left at a marker and cross the 4-way intersection with the mountain biking trail. Descend quickly through the lower section as you eventually reach the first gravel road, crossing to the other side, before a bit further, reaching the second gravel road. Go left on the second gravel road and walk a short distance down hill to where the trail begins again to the right and follow the trail back down towards Mountain View Drive where you began."
Iona Beach Regional Park,3.9,Vancouver City,Easy,1.5,6.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/iona-beach-regional-park/,"Located just north of Vancouver International Airport, Iona Beach Regional Park is a unique area of land made up of a long, narrow jetty of sand and grass along the mouth of the Fraser River. The majority of the walking route is along the beach or a sandy, unmarked trail before reaching the furthest section that is covered in logs. Sea birds are visible throughout the area as well as a fairly unobstructed view of the Georgia Straight south and west of Vancouver. From the parking lot, walk between the building and to the right where there is a sign. The area is not clearly marked but continue along the beach looking for signs of a trail made by the footsteps of others. The first section follows the shoreline along the beach as the middle section of the jetty is private property. Once you pass the industrial area, you can either choose to continue along the shoreline or walk more inland where the grassy area sometimes shows a trail made from others who have walked on this area. The park is often quite windy and it can feel as though walking is a challenge if you are walking directly into the wind. Eventually you will reach the end of the path and an area where the trail descends onto hundreds of logs that have washed up along the shoreline. You can continue to the end point but watch your footing along the logs as they are often slippery and sometimes move slightly when you step on them. Once you have reached the end of your walk, turn around and retrace your footsteps along the beach, making your way back to the parking lot area."
Iona Jetty,0.0,Vancouver City,Easy,2.0,8.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/iona-jetty/,"The start of the Iona Jetty is on the left side of Ferguson Road next to yellow gates and a wooden map board. Before beginning your walk, you will need to decide whether to take the lower gravel trail, usually for dogs off-leash and bikes, or the upper cement route. If you don't have a dog, the higher cement route is a bit nicer as you are higher up and have slightly nicer views. There are a few points where steps allow for easy crossover between the two trails but they can be more than a kilometre apart. Walk past the yellow gates and walk up the stairs onto the viewing platform for a view of the Iona Regional Park area. Follow the jetty out into the sea as you veers slightly right and you pass the waves lapping along the shoreline. The route continues at this pace and doesn't really change much throughout the 4km. You can expect to see some wildlife, depending on the time of year, including several species of shorebirds, seals, nd even salmon jumping on their return. The Vancouver International Airport is located just east of the jetty and there will be several planes landing or taking off. Around the 2km mark, there is an outhouse on the lower gravel trail and some stairs between the two trails. There are a couple of small weather shelters located along the route too. As you approach the end of the jetty, there is a large cement structure, which is part of the Metro Vancouver sewage system and likely some sort of pump house. If you're on the cement trail, walk down the metal stairs to the gravel and around the cement structure and continue to the end. At the end of the jetty, walk up the metal stairs to a viewing platform where you will have a spectacular view of the area on a clear day. Return via the same route, following the Iona Jetty all the way back to the parking areas in Iona Beach Regional Park."
Iron Mountain Lookout,0.0,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,1.5,3.0,April - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/iron-mountain-lookout/,"The Iron Mountain Lookout in Mission, BC, has an incredible view looking across the west side of Hayward Lake and the surrounding area. The trail is not long but it climbs steeply and the top section can be done as a loop before descending to two separate viewpoints. The route is confusing and not well marked at times as a network of hiking and mountain biking trails exist on the mountain. There are some blue ribbons wrapped around trees that make it easier to follow. From the metal gate, follow the gravel road into the forested area and stay on this road until it reaches a corner where the road goes to the right. This is the part of the route that can be a bit confusing. Where the road veers to the right, look for a trail on the left and walk to that trail. Walk only a few steps along this trail and, almost immediately, look for another trail on the right that goes up into the forest. Walk up into the forest, then just after entering the tree cover of the forest, look for yet another trail to the left that goes up a steep hill. Follow this trail up the steep hill. Continue to follow the trail uphill until it briefly levels and reaches a junction. Go left at the junction and continue as the trail begins to climb again. Eventually the trail will reach another junction which is the one that is the start and end of the loop, however it's not well marked and easy to miss. To complete the loop, continuing hiking straight uphill as the trail continues up a very steep section. The route will begin to climb at a more gradual rate before dipping down into a rocky section. Climb up the rocks, following the path and, once at the top, the trail completely levels as you follow it along a ridge. Carefully make your way down a smooth rocky section and continue to follow the trail as it meanders through the forest along the ridge. The trail begins to descend when suddenly, you reach the first viewpoint. This is the best view as it provides stunning scenery looking across the valley and the west side of Hayward Lake. After enjoying the view, continue to hike down hill, carefully watching your step. The trail reaches a junction where you can walk around and up onto a rocky outcrop to the second viewpoint. This is a great view too. Return to the trail and continue following it downhill through the forest until it reaches the trail that you hiked up earlier. Go left and walk back down the steep hill, staying right at the junction, then continuing down another steep section. When you reach the section near the road with the several junction, exit the forest and go left back to the gravel road. Follow the gravel road to the right back down to the metal gate where you began."

Free day-use passes are required to access Joffre Lakes from May 17, 2025 through the summer hiking season. A free day-use pass can be reerved through BC Parks starting at 7am, two days before your planned visit, starting Thursday, May 15th at 7am. Joffre Lakes is one of BC's most beautiful hikes and is a relatively easy trail to hike compared to other more challenging alpine lakes in the region. The hiking trail passes all three lakes and reaches the campsite next to Upper Joffre Lake where Matier Glacier hangs impressively high above. From the parking lot just off the Duffey Lake Road north of Pemberton, head along the trail staying to your left at the fork and in just minutes you will reach the first of three lakes. The view is amazing and the glacier can even be seen from this viewpoint on a sunny day, perched high above in the mountains. Head back up the trail to the fork and turn left to begin your hike to Middle and Upper Joffre Lakes. The path crosses a bridge and continues to follow the trail along the edge of the lake. After 5 minutes, the trail will begin to head uphill and continue through forested area. After about 20 minutes, you will come to a clearing as the route opens up for views across the valley and looking back in the direction you came from. This section used to cross over a very challenging boulder field, however the trail here is well maintained as it climbs steeply. After the trail passes near Joffre Creek on the left, it climbs through a couple of switchbacks where you can see the Lower Lake in the distance. Not much further and the trail begins to level. Just around a corner, views of the turquoise Middle Joffre Lake can be seen between the trees as you continue along the trail. The trail arrives at a viewpoint at the second lake where the glacier serves as stunning background scenery. Continue hiking along the trail as it crosses a wooden bridge and passes a log floating in the water. As the route leaves the Middle Joffre Lakes area, a short trail leads off to the right where there is a scenic waterfall along the river connecting Upper and Middle Joffre Lakes. Return to the trail and continue hiking uphill and within 15 minutes, after crossing another small wooden bridge, you will see glimpses of Upper Joffre Lakes through the trees. While it appears that you are almost there, there is still quite a long walk around the lake that follows a narrow trail with roots and rocks. As you reach the end, the trail opens up and Upper Joffre Lake becomes visible along with the views looking up towards the glacier. The campsite is located near the far end of the lake, below the glacier area. For day hikers, there choose a place to sit to have lunch while enjoying the view. Some people like to sit near the lake, others near the creek, and some like to find a place to sit higher up. After taking photographs and enjoying the alpine views, make your way back to the trail and start your descent back downhill towards Middle Joffre Lakes and eventually back to where you started earlier in the day."

The island itself is not accessible but you can hike to a beach that faces the island and offers great views of Indian Arm. From the parking lot, walk towards the covered picnic table area and look for a trail that enters into the forest and a sign pointing to Jug Island. Follow the trail a short distance and cross the road, being careful of oncoming traffic. Immediately after crossing the road, take the trail on the left. The trail begins to climb quite quickly as you work your way up the gravel path. The trail eventually levels out giving you a chance to catch your breath before continuing through the moss covered forest. The trail begins to widen as you cover quite a bit of distance quickly on the slight downward slope. Eventually, the trail reaches a junction. Go right and follow the trail as it, again, begins to ascend to the high point of the hike. As you reach the top of the mountain, look to your right at the view across Bedwell Bay and the water down below. Continue for a short flat section before the trail makes its final, steep descent down towards the beach area. There in front of you stands Jug Island, just off the shore. Walk along the beach to find a good place to sit and enjoy the views of Indian Arm and watch for eagles and seals that frequent the area. After enjoying the beach area, start the climb back up the steep hill and over the mountain, returning left via the junction and heading back to the picnic area of Belcarra Regional Park.

The park is a great location for families to spend a day in the outdoors during the summer. From the sports field, walk along next to the fence and follow the trail as it descends into the forest. Walk straight through the 4-way trail intersection and continue, crossing a wooden bridge at the bottom. The trail widens into the Cliff Falls picnic area, with access to lots of picnic tables and a view of Cliff Falls to the right. Continue your hike by pass through the picnic area and crossing another bridge with views of the rapids below. Follow the gravel trail up a short hill until you reach a junction and go left along the Canyon Trail. The trail meanders through the forest with the sound of Kanaka Creek below. At a junction with a trail on your left, continue straight along the Canyon Trail as this will be the route we return to loop back to the starting point. The trail eventually descends and continues right next to a much calmer creek before reaching a road. Carefully cross the road and walk through the gravel parking area and follow the trail on the far end to the hatchery. The Bell-Irving Hatchery has salmon on site 12 months of the year, including Coho, Chum, and Pink Salmon at different times of the year. The hatchery is generally open on weekends from 1pm - 3pm and provides educational information on the preservation of the salmon population in Kanaka Creek. To return to where you started your hike, walk back towards the gravel parking lot and cross the road, following the Canyon Trail. Walk up the steep incline and along the path until you reach a junction with a trail on your right. Go right, taking a new route, as it descends into the canyon and crossing Kanaka Creek over a metal bridge. Continue your hike up the steep slope on the other side of the canyon and along the dirt trail until you reach a wide gravel road. To return to the picnic area, go left down the gravel road and within a short distance, the familiar picnic tables become visible. To return to the parking lot or to take a longer route back to the picnic area, look for the trail on the other side of the wide gravel road (it's marked as straight ahead but is actually about 10 meters to the right). Walk along this trail, through the calming forest until you reach a wooden bridge wide enough to ride horses across. Continue following the path until you reach a 4-way trail junction. To return to the picnic area, go left and to return to the parking lot, go right up the hill and past the sport field."

The best option is to walk onto the ferry and either bus to Horseshoe Bay or drive and pay for day parking by the ferry terminal. Check withBC Ferriesfor updated sailing times. From the Snug Cove ferry terminal on Bowen Island, walk up the road past the marina towards the shops. Here you can grab a coffee or snack before your walk to Killarney Lake. To get to the start of the trail, go right onto the first street called Cardena Drive and walk about 100 meters to a green and yellow GVRD parks sign on the left of the road. This sign marks the start to Crippen Regional Park. Take the trail as it heads into the forest to a 4-way junction a short distance away. Go straight and continue as views of the lagoon can be seen between the trees on the right. The trail intersects with Miller Road just beyond the fish ladders. Cross the road and continue along the path now called the Hatchery Trail. When you reach a 3-way junction, go right towards the open meadow. Continue straight through the meadow and across a wooden bridge to another 3-way junction. Go left towards a fork in the trail. Both of these trails lead to Killarney Lake, however follow the trail to the left and later return from the trail on the right. After a few more minutes of walking, Killarney Lake becomes visible through the trees. Go left at the gravel road and a quick right onto the path. A few more steps brings you to a bench with a complete view of the lake. After taking photos and enjoying the view, continue along the trail, past the outhouses and parking area. About 10 minutes further you arrive at another viewpoint along the western shore of the lake. Continue along the trail as it wraps around Killarney Lake, crossing several boardwalks and bridges along the route. On the north end of the lake, the trail exits onto a wooden boardwalk where dead Cedar stumps stick up from the marsh. The eerie looking stumps of Cedar trees are very strong and take decades to decay. Continue your walk around Killarney Lake by walking back into the forest. The trail along the east side of the lake meanders through groves of Cedar and Hemlock. A short path leads to another viewpoint of the lake. Take in this view as from this point the hiking trail only offers glimpses of the lake as it wanders over and around small hills that surround the lake. Eventually you arrive at a gravel road. Go left up the short hill and right at the gate where there is a green and yellow sign pointing the way to the ferry. Soon after, the trail rejoins the trail where you walked past earlier. At the wooden bridge, continue straight taking a slightly different route to return to Snug Cove. At Miller Road, go right and walk alongside the road for 200 meters to a creek and a trail on the left. Follow this trail as it brings you back to Cardena Drive and just a few stops up the street from the shops and ferry terminal."
Ledgeview Trail,0.0,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,3.0,5.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ledgeview-trail/,"The Ledgeview Trails are a series of hiking and mountain biking trails on the west side of Sumas Mountain in Abbotsford. The loop around these trails provides a scenic view at a clearing near the top, some lush forested trails, and a great workout. There are a maze of trails in this area and, while all are well-defined trails, most are not well marked. The easiest way to follow the suggested route is in a clockwise direction, however finding the trail that branches from the main trail is the tricky part. The reason for it being easier to complete this in a clockwise direction is that it's easier to follow the trails uphill and also allows you to see the mountain bikers coming down the hill. From the parking area along McKee Road, walk to the metal gate and follow the trail beyond it. At the first opportunity, go right and follow the wide gravel trail uphill as it climbs and heads into the forest alongside a creek. After hiking for about 10-minutes uphill and crossing the creek, watch for a 4-way junction where there is a trail on both your left and right. Go left onto the trail known as the Amy Fisher Trail, leaving the wide gravel trail. Almost immediately, go left again onto a trail called Mixed Bag Trail and walk down the short hill and across the creek, continuing along the forested trail. You are now on the correct route and following the Mixed Bag Trail will lead you to the top of McKee Peak. Follow the Mixed Bag trail as it meanders through the lush forest, crossing small creeks as it gradually climbs. At a 4-way junction, go straight as the trail begins to climb at a higher pace. The trail eventually reaches another junctions and there will be several junctions that follow. In general, the key to following the correct route is to stay on the Mixed Bag trail and to continue hiking uphill. There are 3 junctions within a minute of each other, in order, at the first junction go, right, then left, then another left. After a few more minutes, go right at another junction and continue uphill. Just a short distance further and the trail you have been hiking on called Mixed Bag ends when it meets a trail called Paper Route. You will know you are in the correct place because there is a very steep hill on the left with some mountain bike obstacles and on the right, there is a view point with a steep drop. Go left and walk up the very steep hill, paying close attention to any mountain bikes that may be coming down the hill. Continue up the steep section, over the rocks, until you reach the top of the McKee Peak  where the radio tower is located. There is no view at the top of McKee Peak, so continue past the fenced in tower, staying to the right and following the trail as it gradually begins to descend. Within 5-minutes, the trails exits the forest at a clearing where there is a scenic view looking down towards Abbotsford and across the valley. After enjoying the view, walk along the worn path, down the steep section of the clearing as you continue to enjoy the views. The trail re-enters the forest and is now a wide, gravel trail that is easy to follow. Stay on this wide gravel trail as it will take you all the way back to the parking area. The wide trail continues descending and passes a metal gate. Sections of the trail are fairly flat and other sections descend quickly over loose rock, be sure to watch your footing as you go. Eventually, the trail's elevation drops quickly and you pass the junction that you took earlier to begin the loop. Stay on the wide gravel trail and follow it back, crossing the creek and keeping the creek to your left. Within minutes, you return to McKee Road close to where you parked."
Levette Lake Loop,2.6,Howe Sound,Intermediate,5.0,11.0,May - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/levette-lake-loop/,"Levette Lake is located in the Paradise Valley region just north of Squamish, BC. The hike takes you though mossy groves and up onto rocky outcrops with views of the Tantalus Range before returning through the Evans Lake Forest. Next to the parking area, a rocky trail that looks like an old creek bed heads uphill and into the forest past a wooden sign with a map of the area. Continue up the trail where after 10 minutes you arrive at a junction. Go left and follow the Copperbrush Trail until you arrive at another junction a short time later. The path to the right is a short side trip to the Copperbrush Pond. After exploring the pond, walk back to the junction and go right to continue your trek through the moss and lichen covered forest. After a few minutes of forest, the trail begins to climb up the edge of rocks and onto an outcrop above. Follow the trail markers as the hike takes you up and over several small rocky outcrops, each offering occasional views of the Squamish Valley and Tantalus Range. Eventually, the trail winds downhill and widens for a final stretch, crossing a small creek before arriving at a gravel forestry road. At the road go right and walk up the hill. Just after crossing a wooden bridge, note the trail on the left side that passes a rock and heads into the Evans Forest. When you return you will take this trail but for now, continue hiking up the gravel road towards Levette Lake. As the road begins to level, a junction appears on the left. Continue past this junction and the next one, staying on the main road until you reach a parking area and a large metal red gate. Just before the metal gate, a short trail ventures into the forest down a gradual hill and Levette Lake becomes visible between the trees. Walk off the trail towards the lake and find a nice spot to take in the views of the lake. After enjoying a break at the lake, walk back towards the gravel road and retrace your steps along the forestry road heading back downhill. Just before arriving at the wooden bridge, enter the Evans Forest along a trail on the right side of the road. Walk along the rocky trail as it gradually heads uphill and eventually arrives at a dead-end. A narrower trail continues to the left and weaves through the Evans Forest taking you up onto rocky outcrops that again offer the occasional views of the Squamish River Valley and Tantalus Range. The trail eventually heads downhill and arrives at an old set of wooden steps carved from a log. Carefully make your way down the slippery steps and continue walking downhill. The trail briefly levels in a valley where moisture helps the moss grow thick. Almost immediately, the trail again begins to climb to another rocky outcrop. Continue as the trail descends a final time to a wider trail known as the Fraser Burrard Trail. A couple hundred meters after joining the wider trail, a wooden sign with a map of the area appears on the left of the trail near a junction. Taking the path on your right takes you to Evans Lake however, you cannot access the nearby forestry camp as it is private property. Take the route to the left, staying on the Fraser Burrard Trail, which will bring you back to the gravel forestry road. At the road, go right and walk for 15-20 minutes back downhill to where you parked earlier in the day."
Lighthouse Park,4.5,The North Shore,Easy,2.0,6.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lighthouse-park/,"Lighthouse Park is one of Greater Vancouver's most beautiful parks located along the shores of West Vancouver. The park boasts some of the largest Douglas Fir trees in Greater Vancouver as well as breathtaking views of the water. There are a variety of trails through the park that take you past old growth Western Red Cedar and Douglas Fir trees. The trails are all fairly easy with only a few having a short hill to ascend or descend. Take a look at the park map at the trailhead and plan your route so that you do a circle through the park and end at the lighthouse. For those who just want a short walk down towards the lighthouse, follow the wide trail for about 10 minutes. To the right of the picnic tables, a path leads up onto a rocky outcrop giving a view of the lighthouse just over the tree line. Another picturesque location is at Starboat Cove. It's a short 15-minute walk east from the lighthouse where there is a sign for a steep path that takes you down to the beach area. At low tide, this is the perfect area to have a picnic and enjoy the view that extends from the Lions Gate Bridge to the University of British Columbia to Vancouver Island on a clear day."
Lightning Lake Loop,5.0,Manning Provincial Park,Easy,2.5,8.5,July - September,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lightning-lake-loop/,"Lightning Lake in Manning Provincial Park is a beautiful lake that is a popular destination for people visiting the park. While it appears as though there are two lakes, Lightning Lake is just one lake with a narrow stretch of water connecting the different sections. A trail loops around both sections and a crossing known as the Rainbow Bridge connects the trails on both sides of the lake along the narrow stretch. This hike describes the route looping around the lake in a clockwise direction. From the day-use area at the large wooden map boards, go left along the paved path next to the beach and walk to the end, where the trail becomes a dirt path. Cross the dam (the dam is not that noticeable) and follow the trail as it stays close to the shores of Lightning Lake. On the other side of the lake where a sign marks the start of the Frosty Mountain trail, go right and begin following the trail around the lake. The trail is forested and fairly close to the lake, offering glimpses of the water as you leave the noise of the day-use area. The dirt trail has very minimal changes in elevation but you must still watch your footing as you have to step over the occasional rock or tree roots. As the water area to the right narrows, a few more steps brings you to the Rainbow Bridge that crosses to the other side. The waterway connecting the two sections of the lake can be fairly shallow during the end of the summer months but is often used by canoeists and paddle boarders to get between the two sections. Walk out onto the bridge to enjoy the view. Continue back along the same trail you were on, following the trail as it continues along the next section of Lightning Lake. Again, the trail is forested but the walk is peaceful and enjoyable. After hiking for awhile, the trail veers to the right and reaches a small wooden bridge over a creek. The water from this creek comes down from Frosty Creek and is quite cold, as it drains into Lightning Lake. Continue walking until the trail crosses over another bridge with a scenic view looking towards the lake. A few more metres and the trail reaches a junction where a route to the left continues on along the Lighting Lakes Chain Trail. At the junction, go right and continue hiking back. Move quickly along the narrow trail until you pass the junction with the Skyline Trail. Shortly after, the trail turns into a wide path that was formerly a forestry road. Continue past the sign to the lake viewpoint as you move northward. Watch for some stairs on the right and a sign that points to the Fisherman's Trail and go right, following the trail that's closest to the shoreline. Within minutes, you return to the Rainbow Bridge, this time on the opposite side. It's at this point that you must decide whether you want to return to the day-use area quickly or complete the entire route. The quicker return route is to actually cross the bridge, then go left and walk back along the route you started, ending near the Mount Frosty Trailhead. However, we will complete the loop by not crossing the bridge and going straight past the bridge, following the trail. It crosses over a small creek known as Little Muddy Creek, before veering to the left and passing through a picnic area popular with families staying at the campsite. Walk past the picnic area and just as the path starts heading up a small hill, look for a trail to the right that follows near the lake and take this path as it heads into the forest. Following the trail until it reaches a point where you can see the day-use area on the other side. It appears as though you are near the end, however this is deceiving because the trail loops around a small inlet, which adds well over one kilometre to the route (this is why crossing at the Rainbow Bridge would have been the quicker route). Continue following the trail as it makes its way around the inlet, passing a picnic area, then turning into a wide gravel road. While walking along the wide gravel road section, watch for a sign on the right and follow the trail into the forest, again, staying close to the water. Eventually, the trail veers left and you arrive back at the day-use area. Walk past the wooden steps, following the trail right to the end where it terminates at the day-use parking lot."
Lightning Lakes Chain Trail,5.0,Manning Provincial Park,Intermediate,7.0,19.0,June - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lightning-lakes-chain-trail/,"The Lightning Lakes Chain Trail is located in Manning Provincial Park and passes each of the weather-related-named lakes, including Lightning Lake, Flash Lake, Strike Lake, and Thunder Lake. Most of the trail is relatively easy but fairly long, making camping a popular option at the Strike Lake Campsite. The Lightning Lakes Chain Trail begins from the Spruce Bay Beach parking lot, which is next to the Lighting Lake Campsite. From the trailhead at the end of the parking lot next to the wooden map board, follow the trail past the metal gates and into the forest. The wide trail reaches a junction a short time later but keep to the right and stay on the main trail passing the next several junctions. The signs at each junction are well marked as you head in the direction of Thunder Lake. When you reach the junction with the Skyline Trail, continue straight as the trail begins to narrow but remains relatively flat. A short time later, you reach the end of Lighting Lake at another junction, where going straight continues your trek along the Chain Trail. Flash Lake is only a short distance away as you begin to see the lake come into view between the trees. Continue making your along the lake where there are some better views of Flash Lake further along the trail. Note: Some maps show a trail that loops around Flash Lake but this trail has been deactivated and is completely overgrown as of 2018. At the end of Flash Lake, you will see a small wooden bridge to the left that crosses the creek, however the trail is completely overgrown on the other side. Continue hiking along the Lighting Lakes Chain Trail as the third lake, Strike Lake, comes into view. The trail passes along the lake, staying in the forest and offering occasional views of the lake. About 500-metres beyond Strike Lake is the Strike Lake Campsite, a backcountry campsite located next to a creek. From the campsite to Thunder Lake, the trail becomes a bit more challenging in some places, partly due to it being overgrown and also passing through a rock slide area just before the lake. Continue through the forested trail as you quickly make your way alongside the creek to your left. It's not that noticeable but the trail through this section descends gradually, something that will become more noticeable on your way back. Watch your step as you pass through several overgrown areas, making it difficult to see your footing. The trail eventually exits the forest and you begin passing through a rockslide area at the bottom of Snow Camp Mountain. The trail is not marked through the slide area but follow the worn path along the rocks as you make your way around the corner and Thunder Lake comes into view. After walking for sometime over the rockslide, the trail reaches a few trees where there is a sign that says ""Dangerous to Proceed Past This Point"". Just beyond this sign, the trail ends as a rockslide has covered the path and crossing it is too risky. Instead, walk back along the trail and walk down the side of the slope to the start of the lake. Be careful walking through this area as it can be quite muddy and the gravel is loose. Depending on the level of the lake, you may be able to walk around a portion of the lake on the east side for a view that looks across Thunder Lake. After enjoying Thunder Lake, return to the trail and walk back along the rock slide, entering the forest. You will notice that a good portion of the trail has a gradual uphill to it, although nothing too strenuous. Watch your step as you pass through the overgrown sections and eventually return to Strike Lake Campsite. From here, the trail is much easier as you make your way past Strike Lake, Flash Lake, and return to the junction at Lighting Lake. Go straight and continue as you pass the Skyline Trailhead before watching for signs pointing to the Spruce Bay Beach parking lot."
Lindeman Lake,4.2,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,2.0,3.4,April - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lindeman-lake/,"Lindeman Lake is a popular day-hike near the Chilliwack Lake area that follows a route uphill along Post Creek before reaching the very scenic mountain lake. The trailhead is located in a parking lot about 1km before Chilliwack Lake on the left of the road and hikers can access the much further Greendrop Lake or Flora Lake from Lindeman Lake.From the parking lot area, follow the trail into the forest and walk down the dirt access road. To the right of Post Creek is a sign pointing the way to Lindeman and Greendrop Lakes. Follow this trail as it heads into the trees for a short distance before starting to ascend. The trail climbs up the well defined route and over some rocky sections before reaching a metal bridge at the half-kilometer mark. Walk across the bridge and over Post Creek before continuing the uphill hike.Just past the 1km mark, you will see a rockslide that fell many years ago. The trail also passes a huge boulder as the uphill climbs at a gentler pace. Another short distance and you've reached the first viewpoint from the south end of Lindeman Lake. Continue along the west side of Lindeman Lake to a clearing with a small wooden dock, which provide one of the best views of the lake.The area around the wooden dock offers the best location to end your hike however, for those inclined to continue to Greendrop Lake, continue along the trail towards a boulder field. Watch your step as you traverse the large rocks. Once at the 4km mark, cross over a couple of log bridges and it's only another half hour to Greendrop Lake.After enjoying Lindeman Lake, follow the trail back down hill from the south end of the lake, passes the large boulder and crossing the metal bridge over Post Creek. Watch your step as you walk over the rocks and before long, the trail levels. Go left and walk the final section back to the parking lot. From the parking lot area, follow the trail into the forest and walk down the dirt access road. To the right of Post Creek is a sign pointing the way to Lindeman and Greendrop Lakes.

Lions Bay Loop,3.7,Howe Sound,Easy,2.0,4.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lions-bay-loop/,"The Lions Bay Loop starts from the General Store and Cafe and follows several hiking trails, passing Crystal Falls and viewpoints of Howe Sound. The trails that make up the loop include the Centennial Trail, the Crystal Falls Trail, the Soundview Trail, and the Harrison Trail, before returning to the start on the Centennial Trail. The trailhead is located on the other side of Centre Road by the Lions Bay General Store and Cafe, to the right of the wall that separates the Sea To Sky highway. Before setting off on your hike, make sure you have checked the parking signage to avoid being towed. Do not park in the General Store and Cafe parking lot. Follow the Centennial Trail next to the wall as it almost immediately crosses a metal bridge over Alberta Creek before continuing along a wide section of trail. The trail then enters the forest and begins to climb gradually as you continuing hiking parallel to the highway but higher above. The forest is beautiful through this section and as you continue hiking along the Centennial Trail, go left at each of the junctions to see the varying views of Howe Sound. The most interesting of all of the views is Arbutus Point, where a short 30 meter trail leads to a picnic table and a view out to Howe Sound. A sign sits there identifying the different islands and mountain ranges. Back on the trail, continue hiking as it keeps gradually ascending until you reach a junction with the Harrison Trail. You will return to this point after completing the loop but, for now, go left and down the wooden stairs as the trail descends quickly. Pass through several switch backs and over a small creek before the trail exits the forest onto a road. Cross the road and walk into what looks like an old, gravel parking area. Walk towards the right of the gravel area and a trail continues in the open above the Sea To Sky highway. Despite all of the noise of the passing traffic, the view of Howe Sound is great along this stretch. Continue walking along the gravel path until you reach the end at a road called Crystal Falls Road. At Crystal Falls Road, turn right and walk up the road until you reach a point where it looks like the road splits to go left or right (left goes across a bridge). Look straight ahead, in the middle of the ""split"", for a sign pointing to the Crystal Falls trail. Follow this trail uphill and before you reach the water tower, look for a trail to the left that takes you a few meters down to a wooden bench with a view of the waterfall along Magnesia Creek. This side trail is within a few minutes of leaving the road and is not marked, so take your time looking for it and make sure not to miss it. After enjoying Crystal Falls, continue along the trail as it climbs quickly before passing a fence and arriving at a gravel clearing next to a road. The clearing to the right offers a scenic view of Howe Sound. Continue your hike to the left up the old gravel, logging road which is now called the Soundview Trail. The Soundview Trail climbs uphill along the wide path as you first pass a junction with the Upper Harrison Trail on the left, before reaching a junction with the Harrison Trail on the right a short distance later (if you reach a paved road, you have gone too far). It's this second junction with the Harrison Trail on your right that you want to take. Follow the Harrison trail as it descends quickly into the forest and, not too much longer, arrives back at the junction with the Centennial Trail where you passed earlier. Go left onto the Centennial Trail and begin walking back downhill towards the General Store and Cafe where you began your hike, making sure to take the paths for the small viewpoint loops that you didn't take before."
Little Goat Mountain,4.5,The North Shore,Easy,2.5,5.5,July - September,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/little-goat-mountain/,"Little Goat Mountain and all other backcountry trails in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park are nowclosedfor the season. The trail will re-open in roughly July 2025, or when the snow and conditions allow. Little Goat Mountain is located in the backcountry trails behind Grouse Mountain and can be done as a short side trip combined with other hiking routes, includingDam Mountain,Goat Mountain, and Crown Mountain. The view from the top offers the best views towards Crown Mountain and Goat Mountain. From the Grouse Mountain Skyride, walk towards the Peak ski run, passing the Grizzly Bear enclosure and veer to the left onto the gravel road that takes you into the backcountry. Follow the gravel road as it ascends slowly and wraps around the mountain, leaving the busy Grouse Mountain behind. At the end of the road, the route narrows and becomes a trail as it climbs at a quicker pace. Continue following the trail as you make your way up hill. At a sign marking a junction, follow the route along the Alpine Trail (not Ridge Trail) as it continues uphill and reaches a zipline tower a few minutes later. The trail should be easy to follow from this point as it continues it's gradually but steady uphill climb, offering occasional views of the surrounding mountains. Pass the junction with Thunderbird Ridge and continue until you reach a junction marking Little Goat. Go left and up the steep, often, muddy hill. After the trail levels out, a short side trail climbs up onto a rocky outcrop offering the best views of the surrounding area. Back on the trail, go right and follow the sign as the trail loops around and descends, meeting with the Alpine Trail again. You have completed the short loop and can either continue your hike to other trails, like Goat Mountain or Crown Mountain, or go right and return to Grouse Mountain via the Alpine Trail."
Lost Lake Nature Trail,4.5,Whistler,Easy,1.5,5.0,March -October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lost-lake-nature-trail/,"Lost Lake is a small lake within walking distance of Whistler Village and is a popular attraction with a beach area and surrounding trails for hiking and biking. The Lost Lake Nature Trail is a less traveled hiking path from the Cross Country Connection ski rental shop, on the other side of the creek from Lorimer Road near Blackcomb Way. The Lost Lake Nature Trail starts to the right of the gravel road to Lost Lake and is easily missed if you're not looking for it. Look for a small, narrow trail that heads towards the creek and follow it. The Nature Trail stays close to the creek and is easy to follow once on it as the bushes only allow you to walk forward or back. Not too far into your hike, the trail approaches the gravel road and continues on the other side. The next section consists of a gentle uphill climb as the trail weaves through the forest. Crossing another gravel bike path, the trail continues where it approaches another bike path before veering off into the forest again. Eventually, the Nature Trail descends and exits onto the gravel road at a junction with Lost Lake in view. Walk a few steps down towards the wooden bridge but watch for a sign on your left that marks the Nature Trail. The route continues along the west side of the lake, offering a few scenic viewpoints and away from the often crowded beach area. The trail meets up with the gravel road, marking the end of the Nature Trail. However, continue your hike by going right and following the gravel road around Lost Lake. At a junction, go right as you make your way down the east side of the lake back towards the beach area. Enjoy some time at the beach before heading west, crossing over two wooden bridges and reaching the junction with the gravel road. You can either return via the Nature Trail route you took earlier or follow the gravel road to the left which also takes you back to where you began your hike."
Lower Hollyburn,3.1,The North Shore,Intermediate,4.5,10.0,June - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lower-hollyburn/,"With trails near the top of Cypress being covered with snow until well into July, a series of trails known as Lower Hollyburn can be hiked at a lower elevation earlier in the season. The trails pass by Blue Gentian Lake, West Lake, and First Lake before descending the less frequently used Forks Trail. The start of Lower Hollyburn begins at the Cypress Mountain lookout point, on the other side of the curve. Park at the lookout and walk east towards the outhouse, following the road on the outside of the median around the curve until you reach the other side where a trail passes through a gate. Walk up the trail a short distance and go right and then another right as you then begin to descend into a creek gully. Follow the Millstream trail as it remains fairly level, crossing several creeks and enjoying the peaceful forest. Eventually, you reach a junction on the left pointing to the Brewis Trail. Continue straight along the Millstream Trail, passing through another black gate and by the Log Dam junction. At the Lawson Creek Forestry Heritage Walk trail, go left and start your uphill hike, passing through a third black gate a short distance later. Continue along the wide, uphill trail, passing the Shields Incline Railway Trail. After 15 - 20 minutes of uphill, you reach a junction with the Baden Powell Trail. Go right and follow the Baden Powell Trail under the power lines, before taking another right to continue your incline. Keep following the Baden Powell Trail by watching for the orange 'BP' trail markers attached to the trees. The trail continues to climb as you pass the Crossover Trail and weave your way through the forest and along streams. After about 30 minutes of uphill, the trail reaches a junction with a sign. Go right to Blue Gentian Lake and a short distance later, you leave the forest and arrive at the beautiful lake, surrounded by raised boardwalks. After enjoying the scenery, walk halfway around the lake to the trail junction and go left by the sign pointing the route to West Lake. Less than a hundred meters later, go left again at the junction. The trail continues to climb gradually before reaching another junction. Go right over the wooden bridge and wrap around before walking up a steep incline. The trail levels out on the approach to West Lake as you, again, exit the forest to a scenic lake view. This is a great place to stop and enjoy lunch or a brief snack. Continue your hike to the left up the wide path, passing reminants of old ski routes and ski jumping signs. The Baden Powell Trail eventually joins the trail you are on from the left, as you continue walking straight until reaching a second junction. Go left down a short gravel hill to First Lake. Just after crossing the wooden bridge at First Lake, go left onto the Forks Trail next to the Ranger cabin. The first part of this trail is well maintained as you pass the Girl Guides cabin on the right before reaching a trail junction with a sign pointing to the left. Do not follow the arrow, instead take the trail on the right as it descends quickly over very rocky terrain, which at time feels like a creek bed. The trail passes by several other cabins before exiting on a gravel road next to the driveways of a couple of cabins. Follow the gravel road downhill and go right onto the main service road. Pass a junction to the right with a TV tower barely visible between the trees and immediately start looking for a trail on the left marked with coloured ribbon. If you reach the paved Cypress Road, you have gone too far. Take the steep trail down and climb over the wooden biking obstacles. The trail continues to descend until reaching a junction with the Trans Canada Trail in a clearing. Go left, briefly staying in the clearing before the trail veers to the right and continues its rapid downhill descent through the forest. Pace yourself accordingly, as the downhill section can be difficult on the knees. Go right at the next junction and continue descending before the trail starts to level out as you hear cars in the distance driving up the Cypress Bowl Road. Go right yet again and pass through a black gate as the trail exits the forest and you find yourself high above the road and the viewpoint on the other side. Follow the trail to the left over the grass and back down to where you started in the curve of the road, before walking around the outside of the median and back to the parking area."
Lower Lynn Creek,0.0,The North Shore,Easy,2.5,9.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lower-lynn-creek/,"The Lower Lynn Creek area connects several North Vancouver parks with a route that goes to a viewing platform at the mouth of Lynn Creek looking out towards Burrard Inlet. The walk is more urban than most as it makes its way through Inter River Park, Bridgman Park, and out to Harbourview Park. There are several dog off-leash areas along the route which makes these parks popular with dog walkers. The route can begin from various points but this description starts from Inter River Park and follows Lynn Creek in a downstream direction. From the end of the parking lot at Inter River Park, walk past the metal gate and down the steep hill, going right onto the wide dirt path at the bottom. Follow the path until it reaches the Inter River Trail next to Lynn Creek. Go left and begin walking in a downstream direction along the wide gravel path. The trail follows Lynn Creek, with occasional views of the creek. You can explore some of the small paths that go down to the rocky creekside along the way. When the trail reaches a bridge, cross the bridge over Lynn Creek and immediately go left, continuing in a downstream direction. The forest path continues before reaching an open gravel area, which is a popular dog off-leash area. Stay to the side and continue walking downstream as you pass under the Highway overpass. Go left at the junction and pass under the Keith Road overpass as you enter Bridgman Park. The trail continues through Bridgman Park as the park narrows with nearby business closeby. The trail will eventually arrive at the busy Main Street, and perhaps the unpleasant part of the route. With no way to get to the other side along a trail, go left and walk along the sidewalk to the traffic lights at Lynn Avenue. There is no direct crosswalk across Main Street, so you will have to cross three times, going across Lynn Avenue, then Main Street, then across the driveway for the small mall, before walking back towards Lynn Creek. Now that you are on the other side of Mains Street, watch for some stairs to your left as you approach Lynn Creek but do not cross over Lynn Creek. Walk down the stairs and follow the trail through the short forested area. The trail will reach a set of metal stairs. Walk down these stairs and follow the metal, raised platform underneath the train tracks but above Lynn Creek. Once you reach the end of the platform, you have arrived at Harbourview Park. Continue to follow the trail through Harbourview Park as the narrow park is wedged between Lynn Creek and the busy port area. There are several views along the way that look over Lynn Creek and up towards the North Shore's scenic mountains. At the end of Harbourview Park, there is a metal view platform with stairs to a viewpoint overlooking Burrard Inlet. This is a great view of the harbour, looking across to Vancouver and also back up the lower Lynn Creek section. After enjoying the harbour views, return the same direction that you arrived and follow the trails along Lynn Creek. Walk along the platform under the train tracks and then cross Main Street at the lights. Walk to the west side of Bridgman Park and follow the trail back up, passing under the highway overpass and entering Inter River Park. Cross the bridge over Lynn Creek and continue further back up to where the wide trail is on the right, walking back up the steep hill to the parking lot where you began."
Lynn Loop,4.3,The North Shore,Easy,1.5,5.1,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lynn-loop/,"Lynn Headwaters Regional Park has many trails that offer a variety in choosing shorter hikes to longer day hikes. Lynn Loop is a short trail that takes you up through the forest before looping back along the rushing water of Lynn Creek. From the parking lot, walk past the yellow gate towards Lynn Creek and over the bridge. Take in the rushing water below with Mount Fromme towering in the backdrop before continuing towards the signboard. Check the map of the park area and familiarize yourself with where you are and where the Lynn Loop Trail is. Head to the right along the service road until you reach a sign on your left marking the Lynn Loop Trail. Turn left and continue past the sign as you make your way up the steep hill. After walking uphill for about 10 minutes, the trail levels out and wanders through a forest filled with Cedar and Hemlock trees. On this trail you will pass a sign for a lookout. This section goes uphill for 10 minutes to a small view, from the top of a big rock, of Vancouver Island and some of the San Juan and Gulf Islands. Go back down to go return to the Lynn Loop Trail. Continue along the trail as it meanders through the forest, past mossy stumps and beautiful trees. After 2km, you will reach a fork in the trail known as the Second Debris Chute. At this point, if you wish to extend your hike by an additional 4.5km, continue right along the trail to the Third Debris Chute. Otherwise, head left down the hill towards the rushing water sound of Lynn Creek. The result of big windstorms can be seen along the way as evidenced by big piles of logs that have snapped and fell down. The trail meets up with the service road that follows Lynn Creek. Follow the gravel road for 1.7km catching occasional glimpses of Lynn Creek as you make your way back towards the signboard. If you signed in, make sure to sign out before walking back to the parking lot across the bridge."
Lynn Peak,3.8,The North Shore,Intermediate,4.0,9.0,June - October,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lynn-peak/,"The trail to Lynn Peak is a challenging hike in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park but the view from the top makes the climb worth the hard work. Lynn Peak is sometimes compared to the Grouse Grind as it offers a great cardio workout but is much less crowded. From the parking area, walk towards and cross Lynn Creek to where a signboard is on the other side with a map of the area. Go right and follow the wide gravel road for less than 10 minutes until you reach a sign marking the start of Lynn Loop on your left. The trail to Lynn Peak starts on the Lynn Loop route, so walk past the sign and follow the trail as it quickly heads uphill. Shortly after the trail levels and crosses a wooden boardwalk, a sign marking the junction to Lynn Peak appears. Go right and begin climbing uphill to Lynn Peak. The trail is quite rocky in sections, so watch your step as many of the rocks can easily be knocked loose causing an injury. The trail makes its way through the second-generation growth forest, ascending quickly. After walking for about 40 minutes, a small view of Seymour Mountain appears on the right, much of which has grown over. Continue hiking uphill as the trail begins to level and heads through some sections with flatter grades. Another 30-40 minutes later, you reach a viewpoint with a much clearer view of Seymour Mountain and the red radio towers that broadcast to Vancouver. Enjoy the view before continuing up the rocky trail as the grade steepens once again. About 20 minutes further, there is a viewpoint on the left that is sometimes easy to miss. It looks over to the west towards Grouse Mountain and on a clear day, out into the Georgia Strait. From this point, it is just a short uphill section and a final short, steep climb that brings you to the most spectacular view of the day at Lynn Peak. The viewpoint looks out towards Seymour. The city and as far away as the USA can been seen on a sunny, clear day. Find a place along the rocks to sit and soak in the view before heading back. There is a trail that continues from this point to the summit, however there are no views at the summit and most people only make it to the last viewpoint, which is known as Lynn Peak. For those wanting a slightly longer hike, follow the less-used trail for another 20 minutes where pink ribbons mark this section instead of the yellow markers that lead to the peak. Once you've enjoyed the views, hike back downhill eventually meeting up with the Lynn Loop Trail. Go left onto the trail and then right onto the gravel road as you retrace your steps back to the Lynn Creek crossing and parking lot area."
Mamquam Falls,3.4,Howe Sound,Easy,0.75,1.6,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mamquam-falls/,"Mamquam Falls is a scenic waterfall in Squamish, BC, that follows a trail along the river before looping back through the forest. The waterfall and canyon area are beautiful and the short walk can be done most times of the year. The hike can be done as a loop and this description follows the route in a counter-clockwise direction. Walk to the metal gate next to the parking area and continue past the gate, heading down the hill. The short walk takes you down to a bridge over the Mamquam River. When you are standing on the bridge, you are standing over Mamquam Falls, however the waterfall is not visible from the bridge. Do not cross the bridge (you can walk onto it and look at the view), instead, just before the bridge on the left side, walk to an area where there is a clearing. In that clearing, a trail starts and goes into the forest, immediately descending through the forest. Continue to follow this trail until you reach a wooden platform on the right with a view of the river and Mamquam Falls. There is a building used by the power company on the other side of the river, so the view is not quite as spectacular as some photos may show but it's still a beautiful view of the canyon. After enjoying the view, continue hiking along the trail heading in a downstream direction. The trail weaves its way through the forest, offering views of the river as you pass through the often lush forest. The trail eventually reaches a short trail to the right, where you can walk right to the river's edge. Continue hiking along the trail and it reaches its end at a turnaround for vehicles. This area is often locked by a gate, however it is sometimes used as a kayak put-in on the Mamquam River. After enjoying the view, follow the gravel road that leaves this area and head up the steep hill. The road will eventually pass a metal gate and return exit into a clearing, returning you to the parking area where you began your walk."
Maplewood Flats,4.1,The North Shore,Easy,0.75,2.5,year-round,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/maplewood-flats/,"Managed by the Wild Bird Trust of British Columbia, Maplewood Flats Conservation Area is a popular bird watching park and a great place for a family outing along Burrard Inlet. Located just east of the 2nd Narrows Bridge in North Vancouver off the old Dollarton Highway, there are more than 200 hundred species of birds that area spotted in the park annually. From the parking area, walk south towards Burrard Inlet along the gravel trail passing the Nature House and picnic tables. Stay on the main trail and a few minutes later, you reach the wooden bridge that crosses over the old barge channel. There is a section of beach just left of the bridge, before walking onto the bridge, known as Osprey Point which offers scenic views of the harbour and your first glimpses of the wildlife nearby. After crossing the bridge, go left and start the loop in a clock-wise direction. The trail heads south and wraps around the shore where it meets a short path that leads to a viewpoint of the harbour. Back on the main trail, the next path to the left leads to a viewing area of the Salt Marsh where the terrain is rocky and popular amongst the seagulls. Continue along the loop until you reach a viewing area on the west side of the pond, where you may see several species of ducks, including the uniquely coloured wood duck. Beyond this viewing area, the trail continues through a wooded section, wrapping around the park until reaching the service road. Follow the service road and go left at the junction where to your immediate left there is a view of the Dragonfly Pond. The trail continues to another junction, where the left route leads to the top of the hill where there are 2 viewing points, both fairly covered by the surrounded trees. Back at the junction, take the other route to the right and the trail rejoins the original route as you go left and cross back over the wooden bridge. After returning to the east side of the park, watch for the trail to the mud flats on your right and follow this route where it branches to a viewpoint on the right. Back on the mudflat route, go right at the next junction and pass through the fence out onto the beach area with the mudflats on your left. Be sure to stay out of this area as the sensitive eco-system would be easily damaged by people walking through the protected bird habitat. Walk back out of the mudflats along the trail and go right, continuing the small look as it quickly meets back up with the main trail a few meters from the entrance to the park."
Mike Lake,4.2,Ridge Meadows,Easy,0.75,2.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mike-lake/,"A free day-use pass is required for all hiking trails in Golden Ears Provincial Park fromMay 16 to September 1, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. Mike Lake is a short but scenic trail located in Golden Ears Provincial Park. A lot of hikers pass by the lake on the way to Alouette Mountain but the trail is also perfect for families wanting a short nature walk. We will follow the trail in a clockwise direction starting from the yellow gate at the end of the gravel parking area. Walk past the gate and continue along the gravel road. This access road connects to the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest that is managed by the University of British Columbia. After a short walk, go right at the sign marking 'Lake Trail'. Follow the trail as it weaves its way downhill, over many tree roots through the calm and quiet forest. As the trail levels, you catch a quick glimpse of the lake. Continue following the trail and a few minutes later, you reach a much clearer view of the lake from the north side. After enjoying the view, continue following the trail as it makes its way through the lake side forest before reaching a junction. Go left at the junction. Do NOT go right as the trail abrupt ends in a dense brush area. Only a short distance later and the trail merges with the Incline Trail, the route used to reach the much more difficult Alouette Mountain Trail. Cross the wooden bridge on the right and a short walk brings you to the gravel road you drove up earlier. Go right up the right and return to the parking lot. Before returning to the car, walk down the gravel trail at the edge of the parking lot and out onto the wooden dock for a complete view of Mike Lake."
Minnekhada Regional Park,4.3,Tri Cities,Easy,2.5,10.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/minnekhada-regional-park/,"Minnekhada Regional Park is a peaceful nature sanctuary located near the Pitt - Addington Marsh Wildlife Management Area. Before starting your walk, take a look at the board next to the parking lot and feel free to grab a map of the park if they are available. Walk along the path a short distance towards the first fork and take the trail on the right called the Lodge Trail. Five minutes later, continue right at the next fork and the first views of the lower marsh can be seen. A few more steps and the trail emerges from the trees along a dike that offers a scenic view of the area. Watch for Wood Ducks, beavers, and other wildlife that make their homes in this protected marshland. Continue along the trail as it circles around the southwestern edge of the marsh before reaching a picnic area. The viewing platform offers another vantage point of the entire area. From the picnic area, take the Fern Trail as it heads back into the forest and gradually uphill for the next 2.7km. Approximately 25 minutes later, you reach a sign which points to Addington Lookout to the right. If you have time, this is a nice viewpoint, however, if you are short on time, save your energy for the High Knoll viewpoint. Turn left at the fork and walk up a few short switchbacks before continuing through the forest. After another 15 minutes, a sign points to the Low Knoll on your left. Take this detour for a beautiful view of the marsh below. Retrace your footsteps back to the main trail and turn left at the sign. At the bottom of a short hill, the trail forks. Go right and continue your walk as you make your way towards the High Knoll. 15 minutes later, you come to the fork that points to the High Knoll off to the right. The High Knoll is only a short distance from here, however, the trail is much steeper than any sections you have passed thus far. Follow the trail as it makes its way uphill before eventually flattening out and ending at an amazing viewpoint. Facing south, the view from the High Knoll overlooks the Lower Marsh and the Pitt River as it flows past farmland below. On a clear day, Mount Baker in Washington is visible. After soaking in the view, retrace your steps back downhill towards the fork and turn left, heading in the same direction you came. Watch for a fork in the trail a short distance later on your right and follow that. Continue downhill through the forest of Cedars and turn right onto the Mid-Marsh Trail after the bridge. This trail weaves around rocky outcrops in sections as it descends towards the marsh. 15 minutes or so later, you exit the trees and cross the dike dividing the upper and lower marsh areas. Cross the dike and head back into the forest on the other side to a fork in the trail. Go left a short distance and then take the Meadow Trail on the right as it weaves through the trees and eventually exits back onto a main trail. A few more steps and you are back at the parking lot where you began."
Moon Rock Trail,0.0,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,1.25,3.2,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/moon-rock-trail/,"The Moon Rock Trail in Mission, BC, is a fairly short hiking route that ends at a giant rock next to a scenic viewpoint that looks towards Hatzic Lake and the Fraser River. There is a makeshift ladder that helps to climb onto the giant boulder for a better view of the area. The trail begins from the top of Doyle Street next to a wooden sign and follows the Cranks Trail for the first half of the route. After walking into the forest, go left at the first trail sign to follow the Cranks Trail. The trail climbs gradually until it reaches another junction. Go right and continue to follow the Cranks Trail. The route passes through a series of switchbacks as it gradually ascends the hill. When the trail reaches a junction with a wide trail, go left on the wide trail and walk just a few steps, then immediately go right and up a narrow trail. This is easily missed and is almost like a 4-way junction, but the trail you approach on does not quite align with the one you need to continue on. It's at this junction that you leave the Cranks Trail. The narrower trail continues up hill before reaching a logged opening in the forest. Follow the trail to the left and walk alongside the clearing, staying in the trees as the path begins to flatten and reaches an old gravel road. Go straight at the gravel road and a short distance further, you will see the giant Moon Rock ahead with a viewpoint just beyond. There is a rickety ladder against the boulder to help you climb onto the rock. The view on a clear day looks over Hatzic Lake, the Fraser River, over Abbotsford, and even as far as Mount Baker in the United States. Once you have enjoyed the view, return via the same route, crossing over the old road and following the trail back downhill past the logged clearing. When the trail reaches the junction with the wider trail, make sure to walk a few steps down to your left, then immediately go right and down the narrow trail to follow the Cranks Trail back downhill. The downhill walk goes quite quickly as there are not too many uneven spots and the route is not overly steep."
Mount Cheam,4.5,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,4.5,9.5,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-cheam/,"One of the most spectacular views in the Fraser Valley, Mount Cheam offers a 360-degree panoramic view from Chilliwack and the communities along the Fraser River, Jones Lake, the surrounding peaks, and Mount Baker to the south. The trail to the peak of Mount Cheam is not as difficult as gaining access to the trailhead as the Forest Service Road requires a rugged 4-wheel drive vehicle. From the parking area, climb over the logs and walk along the old section of gravel road past the logged hillsides. Already there are great views of the surrounding mountains and the snow-covered Mount Baker in Washington State can be seen in the distance. After a 15-minute walk, you reach the end of the old logging road and a trail begins off to the left. It descends slightly into a meadow which is generally lush with colourful wild flowers in August. Cross the small creek and continue to Spoon Lake. From this point on, the steep uphill trail begins. Follow the trail and go right at the junction as the path cuts between the beautiful flowers and tall grass. As you make your way up the trail, don't forget to look back to admire the changing view while you catch your breath. After 40 minutes or so, the trail levels as you reach the upper pond. Depending on the time of year, this can either be an empty rock bed or a small pond on the left of the trail. Continue along the trail as it begins to ascend once again, going through a series of switchbacks as it hugs the side of the mountain. As you climb, the vegetation begins to thin utnil you reach the point where the trail and sides are loose rock. A worn path marks the route to the summit. After another 30-40 minutes of uphill, you reach the ridge which offers the first reward for all your hard work; a view of the Fraser Valley far below. On a clear day you are able to see the community of Agassiz, Chilliwack, and Harrison Lake. Before the Forestry Road was built the old trail to Cheam used to ascend from the left of the ridge, over the mountain and starting from a farm far below. This route used to climb over 2000 meters in elevation and took more than 11 hours! From the ridge, it's just a short hike to the Summit of Mount Cheam where you can experience an unobstructed 360-degree view of the entire region. Some of the highlights include Lady Peak immediately to the south, Mount Baker off in the distance, Jones Lake below, and the entire Fraser Valley. A word of caution: Do not venture close to the edge as the loose rocks have given way in the past and taken several people over the sheer cliff to their deaths. For this reason, the north side of the summit has been named Angel's Bowl and several plaques at the summit are a stark reminder of the dangers. After enjoying the view at the summit, head back down following the route you came from and return to the parking area for the long, bumpy drive back to the Chilliwack Lake Road."
Mount Crumpit,4.0,Howe Sound,Intermediate,3.5,6.0,April - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-crumpit/,"Mount Crumpit in Squamish is located next to the Stawamus Chief and has some pretty spectacular views for a hike that is not as popular as others in the region. There are several viewpoints that look towards the Chief, Howe Sound, and across the town of Squamish towards several of the mountains to the west. One thing to note before starting this hike is there are a lot of trails around Mount Crumpit and they are like a maze if you are not prepared. There are trail signs at some junctions but it is not always clear which junction you are at or the trail names are on signs attached to trees that are easy to miss. Be prepared for this with a good map and navigation tools, like a GPS or compass. This description follows a clockwise loop, however the trail can be completed in the opposite direction too. The trail that descends from Mount Crumpit in the clockwise direction is quite steep, so if you prefer to hike up a steep trail instead of down, you may consider hiking the trail in a counter-clockwise direction. From the trailhead on Westway Avenue, enter the forest and cross the bridge. Immediately go left and follow the wide trail uphill along an open section as the trail levels and you quickly make time. When the trail crosses some boardwalks, go right at the junction and onto the S&M Connector Trail. After walking for about 1km, you reach a junction with a sign for the Fatherside Trail to the right. Go right and follow the Fatherside Trail. The next section of the route is a bit confusing as there are several junctions but it's important to stay on the Fatherside Trail (the signage is not that great). Go right at the first junction, then a very sharp left at the second junction. The trail goes up a gradual hill before dipping down slightly and veering to the right. Go straight at a 4-way junction and, after the 4-way junction, keep an eye out for a trail on the right. When you reach a trail that goes to the right, there should be a sign on the tree labeled the Woodpecker Trail. Go right and follow the Woodpecker Trail as it climbs steeply up the side of Mount Crumpit. After climbing uphill for about 10-15 minutes, you reach a junction. Go left and follow the trail up onto the rocks for a worthwhile viewpoint that looks North towards several mountain ranges. Once you have enjoyed the viewpoint, return to the main trail and continue. Shortly after, you reach another junction where there is a sign that points one direction to the longer route and the other to the shorter route. Go right and follow the trail in the direction of the shorter route. After hiking for another 5-10 minutes, the trail reaches another junction. Go left at this junction downhill a short distance and the trail exits the forest onto a rocky bluff with a great view of the Chief looking across the Mamquam FSR. Return to the main trail and follow it a short distance until it suddenly seems like it ends. It doesn't end but actually continues to the right up a steep rock scramble, requiring the uses of your hands, as you make your way up. It's a short scramble and before you know it, you reach the top where there is yet another great view of The Chief and Howe Sound. Continue following the trail and go left at a junction as the trail goes downhill slightly before climbing again and wrapping around the mountain to a viewpoint near the peak of Mount Crumpit. You can walk to the peak just off the trail to the left but there is no view as most of the views are along the trail itself. Follow the trail further until you reach another view looking south. This is the final view point near the top before the trail descends. After enjoying the viewpoints near the top of Mount Crumpit, follow the trail a short distance before it begins to descend quickly down a very steep route. The loose dirt can be slippery so take care to watch your step and take your time. Go right at a junction and continue a short distance to another junction with a sign. This time go left and follow the Deep Ends Trail to the S&M Connector. The trail begins to climb uphill again and then it feels like it ends again. Follow the worn path up the rocky slope to where a dirt trail continues as you make your way over the rock and then begin to descend again. A short distance after the hill, a trail goes off to the left to a rocky bluff. This is worth exploring as it's one of the best views as you walk out onto the rocks with a full view of the Chief and Howe Sound in front of you. Walk to the right a bit where there is a wooden bench looking at the view to the North West. Return to the main trail and continue downhill as the trail again descends down some steep section. One section is a bit tricky where you will have to carefully lower yourself over a rock, using your hands to hold onto some other rocks on the side. The pace quickens as the trail continues downhill at less of an incline. Go right at two separate junctions and a short distance further, you return to the S&M Connector Trail where you passed by the fallen log earlier. It may not be recognizable at first but go left for about 50-metres and you reach the boardwalks at the junction with the S&M Connector Trail. At the boardwalks, go left and follow the trail through the open section that you hiked earlier, returning down the hill. Watch for the trail to the right and follow it, crossing the wooden bridge and returning to Westway Avenue where you began."
Mount Daniel,4.0,Sunshine Coast,Intermediate,2.5,5.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-daniel/,"Mount Daniel is a steep hike on the Sunshine Coast that provides incredible views of the Pender Harbour region. Located in Garden Bay Marine Provincial Park, the trail climbs through the forest to the first peak before descending slightly and heading up to an area near the second peak with several viewpoints. From the trailhead next to the metal gate along Garden Bay Road, follow the gravel road uphill until you reach a junction. Go left at the junction and continue uphill along the wide road as it begins to level. The gravel road ends and a narrow hiking trail enters the forest. Follow this trail and within a few minutes, the trail begins a very steep ascent. Continue following the steep trail uphill as you pace yourself in-between breaths. The trail passes a BC Parks sign marking the boundary to Garden Bay Marine Provincial Park. During the spring or after a rainfall, sections of the trail can be like walking through a creek, so be sure to watch your step. The trail begins to level and you make your way up a section that is not that steep, quickly gaining distance. The trail arrives, at what looks like a junction, and off to the right is the first peak. Walk up onto the rocky peak to take a look, however there is no view as the trees have grown and blocked it. Return to the trail and follow it down a hill into a gully. The trail begins to ascend again and continues through the forest. It eventually reaches the first view through a clearing in the trees. Walk down to the rocky outcrop for the best view as you look down towards Pender Harbour below. Most hikers stop at this viewpoint, however the trail continues to another spectacular viewpoint that is close by. Follow the worn path as it wraps around the mountain to another clearing, this one looking southward across Gunboat Bay and east towards the mountains. After enjoying the views, follow the trail back in the direction that you came, leaving the viewpoints and beginning the descent. After dropping down into the gully, hike back up the hill to the area near the first peak, then go right, following the trail back downhill. As you descend the steep sections, watch your footing on the loose rock. Eventually, the trail rejoins the gravel road. Follow the road back down, going right at the junction and returning to the metal gate where you began your hike."
Mount Erskine,5.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Intermediate,1.75,3.5,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-erskine/,"The views from the top of Mount Erskine on Salt Spring Island are some of the best on the island, looking westward towards Vancouver Island and further north. Mount Erskine Provincial Park can be accessed from two different areas but is most commonly hiked from the Trestees Trail on the east side of the park. The trails in Mount Erskine Provincial Park are numbered 1 - 5 with this route passing along several of the trails in order to see the best viewpoints. From the trailhead, follow Trail #2 from the cul-de-sac as it briefly heads through a straight section before entering the forest and reaching the Provincial Park boundary. The trail continues up hill at a relatively gradual pace, under the canopy of cedar and Douglas fir trees. The first junction is a 4-way junction and marks the start of the loop. Go straight at the 4-way junction and follow Trail #1 uphill. A short distance further, go left and continue to follow Trail #1 as you continue along the forested route. After hiking up a steep rock, the trail reaches another junction with a sign marking the trails. Go right onto Trail #4, which will allow you to see another great viewpoint that you would miss if you continued along Trail #1. When you reach another junction, go left onto Trail #3 and hike up the very steep hill. The trail will level at a viewpoint that looks west towards Vancouver Island. When you are ready to hike again, do NOT follow the trail that goes downhill as this is a very dangerous route. The hiking trail continues behind the viewpoint where there is an orange marker on a tree slightly uphill. Make sure you are going uphill from the viewpoint and the trail will become well defined as you continue walking. Continue up the steep hill as you walk up onto the rocky area with an incredible view from the summit. The view looks west towards the town of Crofton on Vancouver Island and further north towards Penelakut Island. After enjoying the view, continue following the trail heading south in the direction you were heading when you arrived. This is Trail #2 and you will follow this trail all the way back to where you began. This route is slightly longer but the descend is more gradual and easier on the knees. At the junction go left, continuing along Trail #2. The route zig zags through the 2nd growth forest as you make your way downhill, enjoying the forest scenery. At the 4-way junction, go right and continue following Trail #2 downhill as you pass the Provincial Park boundary sign. The trail veers left and you hike the remaining section back to the start where you began at the cul-de-sac."
Mount Fromme,4.0,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.0,10.0,July - October,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-fromme/,"Mount Fromme is located just east of Grouse Mountain and is much less traveled than many of the other North Shore hiking trails. There are some views from the top of the backcountry mountains but the city views are blocked by trees. However, the hike is very enjoyable as it follows the St. Georges and Peer Gynt trails, briefly passing along the Old Grouse Mountain Highway, on its way to the top. From the cul-de-sac at the top of St. Georges in North Vancouver, a trail enters into the forest. Follow this trail as it crosses a wooden bridge and within minutes, arrives at a clearing underneath power lines. Take note of this spot as it is not marked and you will need to return down this path later. Go right and walk underneath the power lines for about 50 meters to the next trail junction on your left. At the junction, go left and follow the wide gravel trail uphill along the St. Georges Trail. The trail passes a radio antenna before going over a small wooden bridge and becoming a much narrower trail in the forest. The trail climbs steeply as you quickly make your way to the first junction. Go left for just a few meters, then right at a second junction as you continue along the St. Georges Trail, gaining elevation with each step. Cross the Baden Powell Trail and continue uphill. The trail climbs fairly steeply as you step over loose rocks and tree roots. Eventually, the trail exits onto the Old Grouse Mountain Highway. This marks the end of the St. Georges Trail. Go left and walk up the wide gravel road of the Old Grouse Mountain route to the first corner. Along the outer edge of the road in the corner is a junction with several trails. This spot can be confusing if you are not familiar with the area. At the outer edge of the road next to a wooden sign post, go right and follow the trail that heads into the forest and uphill. Do not follow the wider trail going straight and away from the road. The trail continues to climb and eventually reaches the Old Grouse Mountain Highway once again. Cross the gravel road and directly on the other side, the trail dips into a ditch where a rope is there to help you up the steep dirt, bank and back onto the trail. The next section, the trail climbs gradually and is much easier than the previous sections. The trail wraps around a gravel pit to your left, however, the gravel pit is never visible from the trail. Continue following the markers. Eventually, the trail becomes steep again and this is the beginning of the final section to the top. Carefully pull yourself up over the rooted trees as you climb quickly. The trail will begin to level as you pass through an open section before reaching a junction. Go right at the junction and the top is only a couple of hundred meters away. On clear days, you can see many of the backcountry mountain ranges, including as far north as some of the mountains in Garibaldi Provincial Park. Crown Mountain and Goat Mountain behind Grouse are visible to the northwest and Mount Seymour can be seen to the east. There are a couple of spots where you can catch glimpses of Vancouver between the trees but most of the views looking south are blocked by the trees. After enjoying the views, return the same route you arrived. Make sure to go left at the junction just a couple hundred meters from the top. Further down the trail at the second intersection with the Old Grouse Mountain Highway, make sure to walk back down the wide gravel road until you see the sign to the St. Georges Trail (it's after the mountain biking trail called Executioner). When you reach the power lines, go right and then look for the trail to the left that will take you the short distance back to where you began."
Mount Gardner,4.0,Howe Sound,Intermediate,7.0,17.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-gardner/,"Mount Gardner combines an opportunity to visit the laid-back island community of Bowen Island with a hike that provides views of Howe Sound, the Sunshine Coast, West Vancouver, and Burrard Inlet. From the ferry terminal on Bowen, head up the main road and turn right on Cardena Road. A few hundred meters along the road on the left is a parks sign for Crippen Regional Park. Follow this trail and turn right at the first 4-way intersection and continue until you reach Miller Road. Cross the road and continue along the trail for another 15 minutes until you reach the end. Turn right to go to Killarney Lake. The trail becomes a wide-open meadow. Continue through the meadow and back into the forest. At the end of this section, turn left at the sign to Killarney Lake. A few minutes later you reach a fork and take the left trail. Shortly after this, you should see the lake. Turn left at the lake and then right immediately after to follow the path along the shore of the lake. After walking for 10 minutes, watch for a trail on your left that is steep (if you reach a bridge across marshy swamp, you have gone too far). Follow this short trail up to the road and turn right walking along the side of the road for 5 minutes. The first street on your left is called Hikers Trail Road. Follow this road uphill to the metal gate marking the start of the trail to Mount Gardner. Continue uphill past the metal gate until you reach the Skid Trail on your left a short distance later. Follow this trail as it winds through a forested area, making its way uphill. After 20-30 minutes of climbing, the trail forks. Go right towards the gravel road and walk a short distance up the road. On your right, after the steep corner, the trail branches off. Leave the road and follow the trail. The trail winds around the north side of Mount Gardner. After 30 minutes, turn left and take the trail with the orange markers uphill to the gravel road. Turn right on the gravel road and follow it as it slowly heads downhill to a fork in the road. Turn right at the fork and head up a steep section of road. Near the top, the orange markers signal the start of the trail again. Follow the markers a short distance up a steep section to the first viewpoint of Gambier Island on the right, Keets Island on the left, and the ferry terminal in Gibsons along the Sunshine Coast. After taking in the view, walk past this point as the trail continues along the edge of Mount Gardner before starting to climb more.  Watch for a fork in the trail and a sign pointing the way to the north peak. Follow the trail as it climbs steadily before reaching a steep, rocky section. Use the ropes to pull yourself up towards the peak. The north peak of Mount Gardner has a radio site facility, which is surprising after spending several hours climbing through a wilderness area. However, a spectacular view can be seen from all sides including out towards the Sunshine Coast on the west side and of West Vancouver and Burrard Inlet on the east slope. From the south end of the peak the trail begins again. Follow this downward and go left at the junction to continue your hike around Mount Gardner. A short distance later a sign points the way to the south peak. There is no view from this peak so continue along the trail as it begins to descend. The trail around the mountain drops rapidly through a series of switchbacks before descending at a slower rate. After walking for about 45 minutes you reach a junction. Go right and continue downhill. Another 15 minutes later, another sign points the way to the gravel road or a shortcut. Take the steep shortcut route that will bring you back to the junction at Skid Trail where you were earlier in the day. Continue down along Skid Trail until it connects with the gravel road. A short walk down the gravel road and you are back at the metal gate marking the trailhead. If you walked or rode a bike from the Snug Cove ferry terminal, head back down the paved road to the main Mt. Gardner Road. Turn right and after a short 5 minute walk the trail on the left side of the road takes you back to the lake. At the lake, turn right and follow the lake passing the picnic area before turning left and a quick right at the sign pointing the way to Snug Cove. Follow the signs or retrace your steps from earlier in the day."
Mount Maxwell from Armand Way,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Intermediate,3.0,5.5,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-maxwell-armand/,"Mount Maxwell Provincial Park on Salt Spring Island has a large network of hiking trails and a few spectacular viewpoints along the route to the top and at Baynes Peak. The hike is best done on a clear day to avoid some of the slippery rock sections and so the viewpoints can be enjoyed. There are several routes to the top, including driving up a very rough road that requires a 4-wheel drive vehicle with clearance. This hiking route begins from Armand Way and there is a longer hiking route that begins from Burgoyne Bay that has more elevation gain. The trails within Mount Maxwell Provincial Park are all numbered and clearly marked at each junction. The route description will follow along several different numbered trails. From the gravel cul-de-sac at the end of Armand Way, follow Trail #4 past the sign that goes parallel to a homeowner's driveway. Make sure to stay on the trail as it continues a distance before veering left uphill and into the forest. The trail climbs quickly passing the park boundary sign and then reaching the first junction. Go right at the junction and continue to follow Trail #4. The trail meanders through the forest with minimal elevation change through this section. Passing a small pond, the trail descends slightly and then passes through a section that experienced significant tree blowdown from a wind storm. A short distance, go right at another junction and continue along Trail #4 as it begins to climb at a steeper rate. During a steep uphill section, the trail passes a 4-way junction. Continue straight and uphill. The trail veers left and continues uphill until it reaches another sign with Trail #5. You will return to this point but continue left and following Trail #4. Continue follow the trail as you walk up a smooth rock section with a viewpoint looking south across Salt Spring Island. Walk past this viewpoint and continue up the trail, watching for a small trail that goes down to the left. Follow this trail down to the left and walk out onto a rocky outcrop with a scenic view looking down towards some of the farms on Salt Spring Island and further south towards Swartz Bay. This is one of the best viewpoints within Mount Maxwell Provincial Park. Return to the trail and continue hiking up the last section. Go left at the junction and you will almost immediately reach the park area at Baynes Peak. Walk to the left where the fencing is and enjoy the views looking down to Burgoyne Bay. Once you have enjoyed the views at Baynes Peak, return to the area where you arrived but look for the junction with Trail #1. This will descend a slightly different route at the top that's more gradual. Follow the forested trail, then go right at the junction onto Trail # 5. Follow Trail #5 as it goes up and over a hill before joining Trail #4. Go left onto Trail #4, the trail that you took to the top, and begin your hike back downhill. Stay on Trail #4 all the way back to Armand Way as you carefully walk down the steep section, then back through the tree blowdown. Follow the trail downhill through the final forested section before veering right, along the trail that is parallel to the private driveway."
Mount Maxwell from Burgoyne Bay,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Intermediate,4.0,6.7,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-maxwell-burgoyne-bay/,"Mount Maxwell Provincial Park on Salt Spring Island has a large network of hiking trails and several viewpoints from Burgoyne Bay to the top of Baynes Peak. The trail passes through Burgoyne Bay Provincial Park before entering Mount Maxwell Provincial Park. There are several routes to the top, including driving up a very rough road that requires a 4-wheel drive vehicle with clearance. This hiking route begins from Burgoyne Bay and there is a shorter hiking route that begins from Armand Way. The trails within Mount Maxwell Provincial Park are all numbered and clearly marked at each junction. The route description will follow along several different numbered trails. From the trailhead just off of Burgoyne Bay Road, follow Trail #3 and go right, continuing along Trail #3 as it heads uphill. The first section of trail is mostly within the trees as you climb steadily. Near a junction, walk to the right out towards a viewpoint where there is a partial view of Burgoyne Bay below. Return to the trail and go left at the junction, continuing up Trail #3 as you are now in Mount Maxwell Provincial Park. The route climbs steadily and follows a creek on the right as you make your way uphill. Go straight at the junction with Trail #7 and continue on Trail #3 until you reach a 4-way junction. Go left and hike up Trail #4. Trail #4 will continue up a steep section before veering to the left and continuing uphill at a more gradual pace. Pass the junction and continue on Trail #4 as you make your way across some smooth rock sections and up to a spectacular viewpoint. Walk up the trail further and looking for a trail that goes down to the left. Follow the short trail to the left as you walk down the hill and out onto a rocky outcrop with an incredible view of the region. This view looks southward across the farms of Salt Spring Island and down towards the Swartz Bay area on Vancouver Island. Return to the trail and continue up the steep hill as you reach another junction. Go left and you arrive at the Baynes Peak area where you can walk over to the fences and enjoy the views. Climb up onto the big rock and you will have a separate view looking across Burgoyne Bay. After enjoying the views, return to the trail where you arrived but look for the marked junction and  go left onto Trail #1. Follow Trail #1 as it gradually descends through the forest before reach a junction. Go right onto Trail #5 and follow the trail as it makes its way up over a small hill and joins with Trail #4. Go left at Trail #4, then begin your hike back downhill. As you hike down Trail #4, watch for the 4-way junction on the steep section of trail. Go right at the junction onto Trail #3 as this one will take you back down to Burgoyne Bay. Follow Trail #3 back downhill, through the forest, the go right at the junction and continue following Trail #3 all the way back down to the trailhead where you began near Burgoyne Bay Road."
Mount Menzies,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,0.75,1.8,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-menzies/,"Mount Menzies is located on the east side of north Pender Island and there is an incredible viewpoint that looks across the water to Saturna Island. The trail is located in the Gulf Islands National Park. There are two different trails that begin from the cul-de-sac. Follow the trail at the end of the cul-de-sac (not the one with the sign post) as it gradually climbs through the forest. The trail is not marked but the first section is easy to follow and continues through a beautiful west coast forest as you gain must of the elevation through this section. The most important part of this hike is finding the location where you need to go left to the viewpoint as it's very easy to miss. When the trail reaches a 3-way junction, go left and start slowly walking down hill but pay attention for a crooked tree on the left as you go down the hill. The crooked tree is only about 15 metres downhill from the junction, so not far. It has a wooden sign on it that says ""Crooked Tree Lookout Trail"". Go left at the crooked tree and follow the trails as it weaves through the forest, gradually going up a small hill. In no time, you arrive at the viewpoint, which is a very steep cliff, so make sure not to get too close to the edge. There is a short trail along the viewpoint area that you can follow to see the view from slightly different angles, all of which look across to Saturna Island. Return via the same route you hiked, following the trail back to the crooked tree. Go right and up the hill, then immediately go right at the junction. Follow the trail back down hill until you reach the cul-de-sac."
Mount Norman,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,1.0,2.8,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-norman/,"Mount Norman is the highest hill on either of the Pender Islands and has a spectacular viewpoint that overlooks Bedwell Harbour. The trail is located on South Pender Island in the Beaumont Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. There are 2 routes to the top of Mount Norman. The northern route starting from Ainslie Point Road is the a bit shorter, steeper, and the most popular route. This description will focus on that route. The alternate route begins from a parking lot off of Canal Road and is about 3km in length route-trip. Beginning from Ainslie Point Road, walk up the hill towards the sign and gate. Walk past the sign and begin the steep hike uphill. After just 300 metres, the trail briefly levels and reaches a junction with the Beaumont Trail. Go straight at the junction and continue to Mount Norman as the trail begins to climb again. Continues to hike along a couple of steep sections as the trail weaves its way through the forest before reaching a junction. At the junction, go right nd walk a short distance to the steps that lead down to the wooden viewing platform above Bedwell Harbour. The view on a clear day is spectacular as you can see across the harbour to the southern tip of  North Pender Island as the tiny boats sail the waters below. After enjoying the view, return via the same route you hiked, first reaching the junction near the viewpoint. The route to the right takes you to the alternate starting point for the Mount Norman hike, so make sure you go left at the junction and return the same route that you took earlier. Carefully walk back down hill, passing the Beaumont Trail junction and returning down the steep section back to Ainslie Point Road."
Mount Seymour,4.1,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.0,9.0,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-seymour/,"Day Use Passes are required for Mount Seymour Provincial Park daily from December 12, 2024 to January 5, 2025 and Weekends and Holidays from January 6 to March 31, 2025 One of the local Vancouver ski hills in the winter, the summer hike wanders up the mountain, passing over a couple of peaks before reaching a panoramic view of the city and the Coastal Mountain Range. From the end of the parking lot next to the BC Parks sign board, walk towards the ski run and follow it uphill to a green sign on the left. The first trail goes toDog Mountain, another scenic and shorter hike then Mount Seymour. Instead, follow the trail that heads uphill and parallel to the ski run. The trails on the mountain are well marked with signs at junctions that have accurate distances to each destination. The trail climbs quickly and steadily away from the parking area. Go right at the first junction and then right at a second junction as you pass alongside wild foliage and over small wooden bridges. The trail eventually reaches what looks like a dirt road but is actually a ski run in the winter. Go left at this point and continue up the wide gravel path staying on the middle route. Do NOT follow the path to the right that goes up a steep hill. About a couple of hundred meters up the wide path, another green sign appears with an arrow and distance to Mount Seymour. Go left and walk down the slight hill, past the pool of water on the right and continuing your ascent up a rocky hill. You will reach another junction with a sign. Go left over the rock and continue following the trail as it briefly descends. Make sure to take an opportunity once in awhile to look around at the surrounding views as the scenery varies from views of the city, nearby mountains, and even spectacular rock slides that occurred over thousands of years next to the trail. The final junction marks the trail to Elsay Lake on your right and Mount Seymour to the left. Go left and up the steep hill as the trail weaves around rocks before reaching a short 400 meter trail on the left to First Peak. Go left for a short side trip and climb up onto the highest point for an incredible view of the city on a sunny, clear day. Back at the main trail, walk past the green marker and watch for orange markings on the rocks ahead. The trail veers slightly to the right, over the rocks and not straight down as the path would seem. The orange paint on the rocks can be worn in areas and hard to see but it?s there and frequent enough to follow, so just keep an eye out for it. The trail descends before heading up another steep slope with lots of loose rock. At the top of this point is Second Peak. Make your way up the side of the mountain on the right for a quick view from this point. Return to the trail and continue following the path as it again descends and passes along a narrow rock with a steep hill below. The trail reaches the edge of more rocks and it?s back to following the orange spray painted markings on the rocks as you ascend the steep rock section of Mount Seymour. After climbing a steep section, the trail plateaus briefly as it winds through the rocks and reaches a section of loose rock between some small trees. Follow the trail up this section and make the final ascent onto the peak. The view from the top of Mount Seymour is truly spectacular on a clear day as you can see Vancouver to the south, part of Indian Arm to the east, Grouse Mountain to the west, and an enormous section of the Coastal Mountain Range to the north. Pick a spot to rest and have lunch before making your way back downhill, following the same route, and returning to the Mount Seymour parking lot."
Mount Strachan,4.2,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.5,10.5,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-strachan/,"Mount Strachan is one of three mountains that make up the Cypress Ski Resort area in West Vancouver. The challenging terrain on the hike to Mount Strachan is rewarded on a clear day with views of Howe Sound and backcountry mountains as far north as Garibaldi  Provincial Park. Another point of interest along the trail is the historical crash site of a Royal Canadian Navy T-33 Jet where several pieces of the aircraft still rest today. The route described here will be a clockwise loop from the Howe Sound Crest Trail and then returning via the Old Mount Strachan route and Baden Powell. The route is challenging at times due to a steep scramble up an area from the Howe Sound Crest Trail known as Christmas Gully. Sections of the Old Strachan trail back town are steep and technical with many muddy sections and snow lingering into July. The start of the trail is well marked up until the Howe Sound Crest Trail passes Strachan Meadows, at which point trail markers and flagging tape are not always obvious. From the downhill ski parking lot, walk towards the Cypress Creek Lodge, staying to the right. Just beyond the lodge is Yew Lake and some signs pointing towards the nearby hiking trails. Follow the Yew Lake trail and watch for the well marked signs as you meander through the beautiful forest before reaching the first of several junctions. Go right and keep following the signs with the ultimate goal of reaching the Howe Sound Crest Trail. The next two junctions are quick and you will go left at each of them, again looking at the posts and going where the Howe Sound Crest Trail is. At the 3rd junction, the trail emerges from the forest onto an old logging road. Go left on this wide route and continue to a small wooden bridge. Cross the wooden bridge as the trail begins to climb at a steeper pace, passing through some switchbacks before reaching a junction with the Bowen Lookout. A couple of hundred meters from the trail, the Bowen Lookout is worth a short side trip as it offers a scenic view of Howe Sound towards Bowen Island. Back on the trail, continue up hill until you reach another junction next to a wooden map board of the Howe Sound Crest Trail. Go left at this junction as you are now on the Howe Sound Crest Trail. This section of trail is fairly flat and you pass quickly through the forested area. At about 1km from the wooden map board, you reach 2 small wooden bridges in an area known as Strachan Meadows. There are no obvious trail signs like before, so make sure to watch for the two bridges. Between the two bridges is a trail on the right side that passes into Strachan Meadows and begins to climb steeply up the rocky creek. Stay just to the left of the creek as you scramble up the rocks. There are very few trail markers to begin but once you reach climb up and over a large rock, a trail appears that follows to the left of the creek through the trees, offering a slight relieve from the rocks. Continue following this trail as you make your way up and over fallen logs, passing the occasional marker. The trail then veers back onto the rocky creek bed where you must continue your uphill scramble up the rocks. Eventually, you reach the top where you are between the north and south summits of Mount Strachan. After a short rest, go left and up the trail to the north summit of Mount Strachan. This side trip is worth while as it's the higher of the two peaks offering a different view of the area. After enjoying the view, return to the area between the two summits and walk up a rocky section onto the south summit. On a clear day, incredible views of Howe Sound and the surrounding mountain ranges are visible. This is a great place to stop for lunch. After taking in the views on Mount Strachan, begin your descent by looking for the 2 orange markers n the back of the South Summit (you may need to walk along the rocky summit until you see them on your left). Follow the trail as it descends towards a ski lift. The trail is fairly steep and technical in this section, so watch your footing as you descend.  Within 30 minutes along the trail, you reach the site of the T-33 plane crash. The Navy jet was on a training mission in 1963 when it crashed in the heavily wooded area the day after John F. Kennedy was assassinated. It took several days for crews to locate the crash site and, today, the area is still preserved with several pieces of the plane amongst the forest. Continue along the trail downhill as it veers left and then passes up onto a large rock (if you reach the ski run, you missed the rock and must walk back about 20 meters). The trail then descends into a ravine area and reaches a junction. The junction is not well marked and you must go right and continue downhill. If you find yourself hiking uphill at this point, you are on the trail to Hollyburn Mountain and should return and follow the ravine downhill. The trail continues through muddy sections as you cross over more fallen trees and eventually reach a giant tree. There used to be a trail to the right that appears on old maps but it has become overgrown and the new maps of the area recommend following the Old Strachan Trail back down to the Baden Powell. The route adds some distance onto your hike as it veers east in an almost parallel direction to the Baden Powell Trail. Eventually, the trail reaches the junction with the Baden Powell Trail where you go right to return to the downhill ski area. Hike along the scenic North Shore forest of the trail as it crosses a few small creeks and within about 30 - 45 minutes, you reach an opening at the down hill ski area. Go left and walk the remaining short distance back down to the parking lot where you began earlier in the day."
Mount Thom,4.3,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,2.5,10.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mount-thom/,"Located in the Promontory neighbourhood of Chilliwack, the steep hike up Mount Thom is rewarded with a scenic view of the region, including Cultus Lake and the Fraser Valley. There are 2 options for hiking up Mount Thom, including parking at the Sylvan Drive trailhead and completing the entire trail to the top. The other, more family-friendly option is to park near the top and just do the short Lookout Loop. This description will focus on the longer route. From Sylvan Drive, walk up the wood stairs next to the creek and by the houses as you quickly enter the park area and continue up a wide, gravel trail. Only a few minutes from the backyards of homes, you reach a trail junction. Go left and follow the route to Mount Thom as the wide trail narrows and climbs steadily. The trail passes through a series of short switchbacks before a long straight stretch wraps around the mountain. At the end of this straight stretch, the trail turns the opposite direction and climbs up a series of steep stairs before reaching another switchback and, again,, into a long straight stretch of trail. Not far after the switchback, you walk up a steep section where there is a clearing on the left and a bench at the top is perfectly placed to catch your breath. While the trail climbs uphill for the most part, there are short ups and downs along the route. Continue to follow the narrow trail as it wraps around the mountain and eventually reaches a junction with the Lookout Loop Trail. Go right and continue walking uphill for another 10 - 15 minutes until you reach the viewpoint at the top of Mount Thom. To extend your hike by completing the short Lookout Loop, go right at the clearing just down from the top lookout point and follow the trail as it passes the junction with the Ridgeline Trail and eventually meets a second junction. At the second junction, make sure to go left and continue along the Lookout Loop where a few more steps returns you to the junction with the trail back down to Sylvan Drive on your right. For those hikers wishing to return to the start of the trail, simply follow your steps back down the mountain, making sure to go left at the junction at the trail back to Sylvan Drive. The shorter hiking route to the Mount Thom lookout can be accessed by parking near the top of the mountain along Churchill Parkway and walking along a short trail that joins with the Lookout Loop. This route is much easier for families and takes about 20 minutes from the parking lot to the lookout (about 45 minutes return trip). From the parking lot, walk down the steep hill and follow the trail as it climbs uphills quickly and passes a trail for horseback riders. Just after the trail levels out, you reach a junction with the Lookout Loop Trail. It doesn't matter whether you go straight or right as the route is a circle and you will return from the other direction."
Mud Bay Park,4.5,Surrey and Langley,Easy,0.75,2.7,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mud-bay-park/,"Mud Bay Park is located in South Surrey and is a nature area with beautiful views of Boundary Bay and a great place to spot many shorebirds that frequent the area. Some of the birds that you may see as you stroll along the trails include the Killdeer, the Long-billed Dowitcher, the Western Sandpiper, and many more. The walk is short and there are two separate sections that can be done as a loop. From the parking lot, walk towards the wooden map board and begin walking along the wide, gravel path. Follow the trail until it reaches a junction on the left but continue going straight and head towards the further loop first. A short distance further, walk to the left and past the metal gate as the trail follows near the shore and away from the noisy highway. This loop that's furthest from the parking lot has several great views and a couple of sections where you can veer off the trail for a closer look at Boundary Bay. Enjoy the scenery as you continue your walk until you get to the end of this section at another metal gate. Return by either going right along the gravel path near the highway, or retracing your steps back along the trail near the shore that you just walked. When you reach the junction where you passed the first metal gate, continue walking back in the direction of the parking lot, but this time go right at the junction you saw earlier. This is the loop that is closest to the parking lot area and it too offers great views of Boundary Bay. The trail continues to meander along the shoreline before reaching the end and turning sharply to the left. Walk the final straight path as it returns you to the parking lot area."
Mundy Park,4.2,Tri Cities,Easy,2.0,6.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mundy-park/,"Mundy Park is a beautiful community park located in Coquitlam, about 45 minutes east of Vancouver. The park is well used by children's sports leagues and is a popular place to go for a walk. Start your walk from the east park entrance off of Mariner Way in the gravel parking lot area. Cross the paved path and follow the gravel pathway into the forest until just a short distance later, you reach Lost Lake on your right. Enjoy the view of the lake before continuing your walk to the first junction. The park has a network of trails but there are three main trails that make it easy to plan out your walk. The Perimeter Trail is a 4km loop that wraps around the entire park area. There are two trails that cross through the middle of the park which are just over 1km each. One is called the Interlaken Trail, which travels in a east / west direction, and the other is the Waterline Trail, which travels in a north / south direction. For our purposes, we will follow the Perimeter Trail in a counter-clockwise direction. At the first junction after Lost Lake, go right onto the Perimeter Trail and follow the well maintained pathway north. The trail briefly merges with the paved path before veering off to the left again, back into the forest. Go left at the next junction, following the signage marking the Perimeter Trail. The next intersection is with the Waterline Trail. This is one of the trails that crosses the entire park from north to south. Continue straight on the Perimeter Trail for several more minutes before making a left at the next junction as you begin to head south. The trail continues up a short hill before approaching some of the sports fields on the right. On weekends, these fields are often very busy with community sports teams. For a short side trip to Mundy Lake, go left onto the Interlaken Trail and then a quick right onto the Old Logging Trail as it descends down to the light. Dogs are prohibited from the Mundy Lake area as it is considered a sensitive habitat area which can be easily disturbed. Continue along the side of the lake and make your way back to the Perimeter Trail near the baseball fields. The trick in Mundy Park is to watch the signage to make sure you are staying on the Perimeter Trail as there are many other short trails that head out of the park into the surrounding neighbourhood.At the south end of the park, the trail goes left and gradually descends passing by several muddy pools. The trail then meets with the Waterline Trail before continuing. After the second junction, you have return to the spot where you started your walk. Go right, passing by Lost Lake and returning to the gravel parking lot along Mariner Way. At the south end of the park, the trail goes left and gradually descends passing by several muddy pools. The trail then meets with the Waterline Trail before continuing. After the second junction, you have return to the spot where you started your walk. Go right, passing by Lost Lake and returning to the gravel parking lot along Mariner Way. At the south end of the park, the trail goes left and gradually descends passing by several muddy pools. The trail then meets with the Waterline Trail before continuing. After the second junction, you have return to the spot where you started your walk. Go right, passing by Lost Lake and returning to the gravel parking lot along Mariner Way."
Murrin Loop and Jurassic Ridge Trail,4.1,Howe Sound,Intermediate,2.0,2.4,February - October,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/murrin-loop-jurassic-ridge-trail/,"Located just south of Squamish along the Sea To Sky Highway, Murrin Provincial Park is home to the popular Browning Lake, offering a great place to swim and have a family picnic during the summer months. The park has several climbing walls and there is a steep hiking trail that climbs up to Jurassic Ridge and the Quercus Viewpoint, both providing spectacular views overlooking Howe Sound. Even though the distance is not long, the rating for this trail to the viewpoint is Intermediate due to it being quite steep. This trail description assumes you will hike up to Jurassic Ridge, where the descent from the ridge has a couple of rope assists and steep, open rock sections where you will have to use caution. If you bypass Jurassic Ridge and just complete the Murrin Loop Trail, the elevation gain will 130m total and distance 2km. The route is best done in a counter-clockwise direction. From the parking lot, follow the trail past the map of the park and walk towards Browning Lake, following the path through the beach areas. This beach area is busy during the warmer months of the year but you will soon leave the lakeside and hike up a trail, away from the crowds. After passing the beach area, watch for a sign and a trail on the right, marking the route to Jurassic Ridge and the Quercus Viewpoint. Leave the Browning Lake area and begin hiking up the hill briefly before descending and arriving at another junction in the forest. At the junction, go right and follow the Murrin Loop Trail in a counter clockwise direction. The trail climbs very steeply, first along dirt and then up wood steps, sometimes which are quite muddy during the off-season months. Admire the large rock overhangs that precariously sit above the trail as you stop to catch your breath before continuing uphill. Not too long into your hike, the trail reaches a junction. Go straight towards the viewpoint as the trail leads out of the forest and climbs up onto the rock, arriving at a wooden bench. Continue past the bench to the end of the rocky bluff where a spectacular view of Howe Sound awaits. Known as the Quercus Viewpoint, this is a spectacular view as you can see straight out into Howe Sound, look down towards Browning Lake, and up towards some of the region's mountains. After enjoying the viewpoint, walk back to the trail and return to the junction, this time going the other direction to continue around the Loop Trail. A short distance further and you reach another junction with a sign pointing to the right to Jurassic Ridge. If you want a short hike, go left and continue along the Murrin Loop Trail, which will take you back down to the lake. For a longer route, go right and begin the steep hike up to Jurassic Ridge. The trail climbs quite relentlessly for about 150m of elevation gain for levelling. Carefully step down over a rock and follow the route as it winds its way through the trees, offering the occasional glimpses of Howe Sound between the trees. Use a rope assist  to descend a rocky section, then follow the trail through a forest as it sharply veers left and follows a worn path up onto a rocky bluff. From this point, there are a few half-decent views looking west over Howe Sound towards the old Woodfibre Mill. Carefully follow the trail markers on the trees as you begin to descend down the rocky hill. A short distance downhill, you arrive at the first of one of the spectacular views along Jurassic Ridge. This view looks out towards Howe Sound and is similar to the Quercus Viewpoint but at a higher elevation. Use a second rope to assist you in descending down the smooth rocky route, carefully watching your step. The route descends steeply to another spectacular viewpoint. After this viewpoint, follow the trail markers downhill as the route continues its steep descent. Eventually, you arrive at a spot where steel rods are embedded into the rock as a ladder. Climb down the ladder and descend along the trail a short distance further, into the forest and to a sign at a junction. Arriving back in the forest at the junction, make sure you go left at this junction to start hiking back to the lake (going right is a much longer route). A short distance further and you arrive at another junction near a bridge. This is where the Murrin Loop Trail meets, if you had not done the Jurassic Ridge section. Go right at this junction and follow the trail as it gradually descends through the forest as you make your way past a couple of climbing areas. Cross over a small wooden bridge, then descend down a hill between two rock faces and a short distance further, you arrive at a second viewpoint with a bench looking towards Howe Sound. Continue hiking down the steep stairs, passing another climbing area to your left until the trail reaches another junction. To return to Browning Lake, go left at the junction and walk through the forest, past the junction where you started the loop, over the small hill and back down to the lake trail. For an additional walk, you can also continue walking around the Browning Lake Loop to return to the parking lot a different way but walking along the trail next to the highway is not the most peaceful experience."
Mystery Lake,3.4,The North Shore,Easy,1.25,3.0,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/mystery-lake/,"Located in Mount Seymour Provincial Park, Mystery Lake is a scenic lake that is only a short distance from the parking lot and a great place for a swim on a hot summer day. While the hike is relatively easy due to its short distance, the trail does ascend about 150 meters and over tree roots and loose rocks. The lake is a popular spot in the summer months for families to hike to and spend time, picnicing with kids near the waters edge. From the Mount Seymour parking lot, walk to the far end to where the wooden map board is located. After checking the map, walk towards the ski lift where a wooden post with a green sign points in the direction to Mystery Lake to the right of the wide gravel trail. Follow the trail as it climbs almost immediately through the low mountain brush. The trail weaves back and forth slightly until it eventually reaches a small pond to the right. Walk over the wooden boardwalks and continue up the the dirt trail, passing an open section before entering the forest again. Within minutes, you reach the edge of the Mystery Lake. It's worth noting that the trail continues to the right and eventually joins with the Mount Seymour trail. However, there are also paths to the left that wrap around most of the lake, so look for a spot to rest to enjoy your time at the lake. It's also a great lake for a swim during the summer months. After enjoying Mystery Lake, return to the trail where you arrived at the lake and begin hiking back downhill. Be careful as you step over the slippery tree roots and loose rocks, making your way past the small pond, and eventually back to the parking lot at Mount Seymour."
Nairn Falls,4.8,Pemberton,Easy,1.5,3.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/nairn-falls/,"Nairn Falls is located along the Sea To Sky Highway (Highway #99) between Whistler and Pemberton. It's a nice, short hike to a beautiful waterfall. After parking, start the hike to the falls from the right side of the parking lot. The trail follows alongside the river with minimal elevation change for about 1.5km. When you come upon a large rocky area, walk up to the top where there is a platform. This is your first viewpoint of Nairn Falls where you can see the upper section. Between the falls and where the river continues, there appears to be a rocky ledge blocking the flow of water. Years of erosion have created water flows underneath this rocky ledge which are not visible. After enjoying the first falls, walk down the rocky area towards the chain-link fence below and follow this fence to the left. There is an opening that you can continue down, eventually getting to the lowest accessible point. Here you can see the lower falls tumbling down into the canyon. Across the canyon are logs and rocks that are part of the debris that has come down with the falls over the years. After taking some photos and resting on the rocks, make your way back up the rocky area to the trail for the short walk back to the parking lot."
Norvan Falls,4.3,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.0,14.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/norvan-falls/,"A waterfall located in the lush green forests of Lynn Headwaters Regional Park, Norvan Falls is the perfect hike that can be completed just about anytime throughout the year. From the parking lot, walk across the Lynn Creek Bridge to the map on the other side and sign in on the registration board. Head to your left and continue walking along the creek as it hugs the river and continues through groves of second growth Cedar. This area was logged in the early 1900's and many remnants from those days still remain along the trail, including an old logging cart where trees are growing out from, old rusty saw blades, and other tools. The first 1.7km is along a wide gravel road which is part of the lower Lynn Loop Trail. As you continue past a junction, the trail becomes narrower and you pass over several small streams, pools of mud, and around small groves of trees. This section of the trail is known as the Cedars Mill Trail. The area is frequented by locals walking their dogs, however the further you continue away from the parking lot, the fewer dogs and people you run into. After the first 4km, the trail opens up into a clearing known as a debris chute. Walk to the left towards the river and take in the views and the rushing water continuously flowing over the rocks as Goat Mountain towers overhead. From this point, head up the rocky debris towards the sign post. Turn left and continue your hike by entering the forest along the Headwaters Trail. In the wetter seasons, the next 2.6km can have several muddy sections. The surroundings are rich with moss that blankets the forest floor and hangs from tree branches. Again, an old bucket and some rusty old tools left over from the logging operations can be seen alongside the trail. The sound of rushing water will signal that you are getting closer to Norvan Creek. As the creek becomes visible, a rugged steel suspension bridge crosses the creek to your left. Instead, go right and walk along a trail that follows the creek uphill. After a few hundred meters, Norvan Falls becomes visible from the trees as the water drops into the creek below. Backtrack a few steps and find the path that takes you down to the rocky edge of the creek where you can get the best view and find a place to stop for lunch. After taking in the falls, descend back down towards the trail and head left back along the route you came from. When you reach the debris chute, if you are running out of time or just want to finish your hike, you can go right and down over the rocks and follow the trail that you took originally alongside the river. If you have a bit of extra time and want to continue through the beautiful forest, go left and continue along the Headwaters Trail. The trail weaves its way through the forest for about 2km before reaching a viewpoint on the right of Mount Fromme. Continue a short distance past the viewpoint to a junction and turn right, following the trail downhill and eventually back to the Lynn Loop Trail alongside the river where you passed through earlier in the day. Continue along the wide gravel road back towards the trailhead. When you reach the signboard, don't forget to deposit the other half of your sheet before heading back to the parking lot."
One Mile Lake,0.0,Pemberton,Easy,0.75,1.6,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/one-mile-lake/,"Located in Pemberton, One Mile Lake is a popular destination during the summer months for families, standup paddle boarders, and people looking to cool off with a swim in the lake. The trail around One Mile Lake is an easy walk and passes over raised boardwalks on one side of the lake, offering scenic views of the surrounding area. Campers at Nairn Falls Provincial Park can access One Mile Lake by following the Sea To Sky Trail for a 30 minute oneway hike to the lake. To walk the loop around the lake, start by the beach area and follow the trail in a clock-wise direction, walking along the wooden boardwalks parallel to Highway 99. You quickly leave the busy beach area and get to enjoy the views across the lake of the mountains surrounding the Pemberton area. Go right and continue following the wooden boardwalks along the north end of the trail until the route turns into a gravel path. Just a bit further and you reach a beach that?s used as the dog off-leash area. On the left is a trail that goes into Pemberton near the traffic light. Continue the walk around the lake by following the gravel path as it passes by a few sections on raised wood bridges and small docks that are popular with swimmers. The trail eventually reaches another junction with the Sea To Sky Trail that goes to Nairn Falls Provincial Park and past the nearby disc golf course. Cross the small wooden bridge as the trail veers to the right and you arrive back at the beach area where you began."
Othello Tunnels,4.3,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,3.5,May - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/othello-tunnels/,"Last Updated: June 18, 2025- The northern portion of Othello Tunnels will open on Friday, June 27th providing access to 3 out of the 5 tunnels. The rest of the route is still being repaired, including the building of a new bridge, and is anticipated to open in the Spring of 2026. The Othello Tunnels are a series of old train tunnels and bridges that cut through the solid granite walls and pass over the wild Coquihalla River. The tunnels are located just east of the town of Hope, BC, in the Coquihalla Provincial Park and the trail is a short, flat 3.5km return route. In the early 1900's, the Canadian Pacific Railway decided to connect the southern coast of British Columbia with the Kootenays and it was determined the best option was a route through the Coquihalla Gorge. Today, the route no longer has railway tracks and has been restored as part of the Kettle Valley Railway Trail, a popular cycling route that follows the old train routes over trestles and through tunnels and is noted for it's gradual change in elevation. The Coast Mountain Range proved quite a challenge to build a railway through and walking over the bridges in the Othello Tunnels area, it becomes quite evident how difficult it must have been. The sheer rock cliffs, the violently rushing water below, and the remoteness makes it seem incredible that any infrastructure could be built in such an environment, let alone over 100-years ago with limited engineering equipment. From the parking lot, follow the signs along the wide trail near the Coquihalla River. The former railroad bed is flat and an easy walk for families of all ages. Not far along, the first tunnel can be seen ahead as you follow the trail into the dark tunnel. The trail briefly exits the tunnel before entering tunnel #2. After existing tunnel #2, the route crosses a bridge where the Coquihalla River rages through the rocky canyon below. Continue walking through tunnel #3 to another bridge with views of the canyon. After walking through tunnel #4, the Othello Tunnels route abruptly ends, although the trail keeps going all the way to the town of Hope. At the end of the tunnels is the turnaround point where visitors walk back through the same tunnels, returning to the parking lot. One other piece of history, due to the canyon's rugged look, the park has made several appearances in popular films over the years. The most notable was Rambo First Blood where the cliff above Tunnel #2 was used in the spectacular cliff jump scene. Other movies that filmed scenes around Othello Tunnels include Fire With Fire, The Adventures of Yellow Dog, and Shoot To Kill."
Pacific Spirit Regional Park,4.0,Vancouver City,Easy,3.0,10.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/pacific-spirit-regional-park/,"Located on the west side of the city of Vancouver, the Pacific Spirit Regional Park offers a network of trails contained in more than 750 hectares of forest. The trails in the park are popular with local residents and accessible year-round. The best way to see the park is to view the park map and determine your own route. However, we will follow a common route that will take you on a 3-hour trip through much of the forest. Once at a clearing, where you can hear the traffic along SW Marine Drive, take the Salish Trail to the right and disappear back into the peaceful forest. This section of the park borders an ecological reserve and signs along the route instruct trail users to stay on the paths and keep their dogs out of the ecologically sensitive creeks. As you walk, soak up the beautiful sights and smells of the Hemlock, Cedar, and Maple Leaf trees. The Salish Trail again meets up with the Imperial Trail underneath the power lines. Turn left and stay to your left as the trail forks a short distance later. After 10 minutes or so of walking, you reach an intersection with the Sword Fern Trail. Head right and take this trail. In the winter months, this trail can have large sections that are covered in mud. At the junction, continue straight along the Sword Fern Trail (also called the Iva Mann Trail) and go left on the Salish Trail towards 16th Avenue. At this point, you can end your hike by heading to your right back along 16th Avenue to where you started. To continue hiking, cross 16th Avenue, being careful of oncoming traffic, and enter the forest on the other side. Continue walking along the Salish Trail and take a right on Fork Trail. Walk under the power lines and keep going straight. Just after the power lines, go right and follow the Lily Valley Trail. On your right, you will see some of the largest stumps in the Pacific Spirit Regional Park left over from logging that took place in the early part of the 1900's. When the trail meets with the Salish Trail, turn right and head back towards 16th Avenue. Back on 16th Avenue, you can again decide to end your day here and walk east (left) towards where you started. To continue through the forest, cross 16th Avenue and continue on the Salal Trail. Turn left on Cleveland Trail, left on Nature Trail, and right on Deer Fern Trail. Walk past large Douglas Fir trees as you head towards the Huckleberry Trail. A short walk along the Huckleberry Trail to the trailhead and you have returned to where you started earlier in the day."
Panorama Ridge,4.7,Whistler,Difficult,11.0,30.0,July - October,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/panorama-ridge/,"A free day-use pass is required from the Rubble Creek trailhead fromJune 13 to October 13, 2025 on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Holidays. Day-use passes can be reserved throughBC Parks2 days before your planned hike starting at 7am. The views from Panorama Ridge are some of the most scenic views in the Garibaldi Provincial Park area. Located on the opposite end of the campsite, high above Garibaldi Lake, Panorama Ridge offers a full panoramic view of Garibaldi Lake, Black Tusk, and the Helm Lake area. While many hikers do complete this trail in a day, the distance and elevation gain to Panorama Ridge make for a very long day. For this reason, some people prefer to hike to Garibaldi Lake or Taylor Meadows and camp overnight, before completing the hike to Panorama Ridge the following day. It is up to you which you prefer however, if you do decide to do this in a day make sure to leave plenty of time to return to the parking lot during daylight hours. From the top section of the Rubble Creek parking lot near the wooden steps, enter the forest along the gravel trail and begin your hike. For the next 6km, the trail climbs gradually through a series of switchbacks and second growth forests. Shortly after the 6km marker, the trail reaches a junction with a map of the area. Take the trail to the left and head towards Taylor Meadows. Another 20 minutes or so of gradual uphill and the trees begin to thin as you enter into the meadows. During the late summer or early fall, Taylor Meadows is full of bright colours from the alpine flowers that are blooming. It is important to stay along the trail in this ecologically sensitive area as some of the flowers and vegetation can take years to regrow if damaged from hikers. Continue along the path as just a short distance later you arrive at the Taylor Meadows campsite. Look up and to your left for a view of Black Tusk towering high above. It's inviting however, this hike will be saved for another day. Keep continuing straight along the trail as it wanders through the meadows, occasionally looking back to catch glimpses of the snowcapped mountains behind you. Another 20 minutes or so of gradual uphill through the meadows and you arrive at the Black Tusk junction. Continue heading straight towards the Panorama Ridge junction as the trail continues alongside a slope that trickles with little streams flowing amongst the colourful flowers. As you pass through this area, observe the meadows below and the occasional rock that has slid down the hill and is now resting among the green foliage. Eventually, the trail reaches the Panorama Ridge junction where a scenic view of Helm Lake lies off to the left. Continuing along that trail would eventually bring you to Cheakamus Lake. However, this route is better done by performing a car-swap whereby one hiking party parks a car at Rubble Creek, and another hiking party parks a car at Cheakamus Lake, then both parties hike and meet at about the midpoint of the trail where car keys are exchanged before continuing along their routes to the opposing parking lots. Instead, follow the route to Panorama Ridge by continuing to the right of the junction, heading down a slight slope before veering to the left and beginning a climb through the alpine vegetation. The climb becomes steeper and steeper the further you continue. Enjoy the gradual climb as the steepest section is yet to come. The trail snakes up the side of the hill, eventually onto a ridge where the vegetation starts to thin and the terrain eventually becomes all rocks. Scramble up the rocky slopes using your hands for extra help and being careful of the occasional loose rock. The trail is not marked as obvious through this area, however occasional markings and obvious wear from all the hikers lead the way to the top. The steep section can be quite grueling but keep in mind the payoff at the end is extremely rewarding.  After scrambling for what seems an eternity, the trail begins to level and the turquoise colour of Garibaldi Lake appears below. At this point, you have reached your destination. The Black Tusk and Helm Lake areas lie behind and even a glimpse of the glacier next to Garibaldi Lake is visible off in the distance. After taking in the view and being watchful of the time, head back in the direction you came from and carefully begin your descent back down the rocky slopes. Watch for trail markings as the trail becomes more obvious as you reach the lower level where the vegetation is able to grow. Return to the Panorama Ridge junction and turn left to make your way alongside the scenic slopes and back into Taylor Meadows. At the main junction, if you are short on time, continue straight towards the Taylor Meadows campsite passing through it and eventually back down towards the first junction by the 6km mark. if time permits however, turn left and follow the trail as it meanders through a series of switchbacks down towards Garibaldi Lake. A short walk down a steep slope, across a small bridge, and following the trail alongside the lake, brings you to a view of Garibaldi Lake and Panorama Ridge in the top left where you were standing a couple of hours earlier. Once you have taken in the view, continue back along the shore, across the bridge, and back up the slope, turning left at the marker. Walk straight along the trail, passing two lakes in the process before meeting up with the trail junction near the 6km mark. From the junction, continue for the next 6km as the trail gradually makes its way back downhill eventually returning to the Rubble Creek parking lot where you began your day."
Parkhurst Ghost Town,0.0,Whistler,Easy,3.0,6.0,April - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/parkhurst-ghost-town/,"The Parkhurst Ghost Town is located off the north east corner of Green Lake, just north of Whistler, BC. The small settlement existed as a logging town from the 1920's to the 1960's before it was abandoned. Today, there are a couple of structures still standing and several artifacts and other pieces of history. The hike is best done as a loop. From the parking area, walk to the end of the gravel road and pass the large cement blocks, continuing towards an old bridge. Be careful crossing this bridge as it has several holes in it and has fallen into a state of disrepair. Continue following the old road until it reaches train tracks and stay on the left side of the tracks. These tracks are still in active use, so make sure not to walk on the tracks and just follow them off to the left. A switch track marks the start of a turnaround that the trains can use should they need to change the direction of travel of the engine. Cross the tracks going to the left and keep following the main line, then cross the second set of tracks that mark the end of the train turnaround. Watch for a sign to the left side of the train tracks that says ""Green Lake"" and follow that trail as it heads into the forest. The trail climbs gently through the forest, as you make quick time through the area. At a junction, go left and continue to follow the well defined route to Parkhurst. The trail has its ups and downs and a few sections can be narrow but the route is not too difficult. There are a couple of spots where the trail arrives at a rocky opening that were once viewpoints, but the trees have grown over the years and now block the view towards Green Lake. Eventually the trail will reach its end and meet with another trail and a sign that says ""Ghost Town Loop"". Go right and head towards the Parkhurst Ghost Town. A short distance further, a junction marks the start of the loop that passes through the Parkhurst Ghost Town. Go left and follow the trail down a slight hill until it veers sharply to the right and you can begin to see remnants of old buildings and other artifacts. As you walk through the ghost town, there is another trail to the left that goes to Green Lake. Walk down this trail and carefully cross the train tracks where there is a short trail that goes to the shore of Green Lake. Return to the old Parkhurst Ghost Town and continue following the loop as you see more old artifacts, including an old truck, an old car, some buildings that are still standing, some that are not standing, and lots of pieces of metal that have been abandoned. After the trail veers right and begins to gradually head uphill, you will walk back to the junction where you started the loop around the old settlement. Leave the Parkhurst Ghost Town and continue to the 3-way junction of the trail that you arrived at with the sign that says ""Recreational Trail"" on one side and ""Ghost Town Loop"" on the other. This time, take the other route back by going straight and continuing uphill, passing a rocky hill to the left and eventually reaching a clearing under powerlines. At the sign, go left and walk down the hill to another junction and go right, continuing to follow the road. The road veers left and then reaches a sign for the Sea To Sky Trail. Continue to follow the gravel road as it is part of the Sea To Sky Trail. A few more minutes of walking along the road and it joins another road. Go right and continue to follow this road, which is still part of the Sea To Sky Trail. Following this road will take you right back to the beginning of the trail where you began, however there is still quite a distance to cover as you head down the steep hill. The road also crosses a bridge over Wedge Creek offering a scenic view of a waterfall. As you descend the final section, you begin to see the parking area below until you finally reach the end."
Paton Peak,0.0,The North Shore,Difficult,4.0,4.5,July - October,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/paton-peak/,"Paton Peak and all other backcountry trails in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park are nowclosedfor the season. The trail will re-open in roughly July 2025, or when the snow and conditions allow. The Paton Peak hike description only refers to the hike itself. There is anadditional 20km(10km each way) that willadd at least 2-hours by bike. Check the time on the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve Gate Closure times to ensure you do not get stuck in the parking lot. Paton Peak is located in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve and has awe-inspiring views that look down towards the Seymour Lake Watershed, across to Cathedral Mountain, and up towards Coliseum Mountain. The trailhead is about 10km each way (20km extra) from the Lower Seymour Conservation Area parking lot and located just off the Seymour Valley Trailway, a paved road for bikers and walkers. This adds a significant amount of distance to your hike, so ensure to account for the added time for your hike or plan to bike to the trailhead and lock your bike to a tree. From the parking lot, follow the Seymour Valley Trailway past the metal gate and begin the 10kms to the Paton Peak Trailhead. If you are riding a bike, you will spend about 45 minutes traversing an undulating road through pristine forest and over small bridges. While the hills can be wearying, remember that most of the uphill you do at this point will be downhill on the trip back. Notice Jack's Burn Picnic site on the left side, the trail will descend from this point through the 8 and 9 km markers. About 250 meters after the 9 km marker, you'll need to start paying close attention to the left side of the road for a paved exit heading back and up into the forest. If you reach the Stoney Creek Picnic Site, you've cycled just a bit too far; turn around and head back and you can't miss the turnoff. After leaving the main Seymour Valley Trailway, the road ascends on pavement for about 100 meters, then turns to hard-packed gravel as it begins to go steeply uphill. Continue on this road for less than a kilometer, cycling in some parts, walking in others, until you reach a small clearing. Lock your bike up to a tree, catch your breath, and proceed through a narrow trail opening opposite from where you entered the clearing. After a minute of walking, you'll see orange tags on your right heading up and into the forest. From here, the Paton Peak trail resembles many other classic North Shore hikes. Beautiful cedar trees, spongy needle-packed trails, and all the other expected sights. That said, the trail is steep and relentless, with switchbacks continuing for the majority of the hike. After about 500 meters of hiking, a short side trail offers a scenic view of the back side of Mount Seymour, Runner's Peak, and other peaks in the Fannin Range. Take a quick moment to pause, gulp down some water, and take in a view of Mount Seymour. Shortly after the view, the trail becomes more difficult, with scrambling over rocks using root handholds, rope-assisted climbs, and more complicated footwork. At no point does it reach the level of mountaineering, and you should never feel especially unsafe, but bear in mind to be careful and pay close attention to your steps. A turned ankle here means a very long day. From here until the peak, the trail continues its upward trend. Be mindful of looking up as you hike to find the orange trail tags in the trees. It's easy to wander off the trail, and while re-finding the trail wouldn't be difficult, it will mean added exertion on an already difficult hike. After negotiating yet another rope climb through a narrow gap over some boulders, you'll soon reach the alpine, and the forest will begin to thin out, offering remarkable peekaboo views of the surrounding mountains, as well as the sheer cliff descending from Paton Peak (remember this sight when you're edging to the precipices at the summit). A few minutes later and you will emerge at a crossroad marked by a cairn and some orange tags; going left and down means heading towards Coliseum Mountain. Instead, head to the right, following tags through the last bit of forest before reaching Paton Peak's inspiring boulders. Scramble up any route you prefer to reach the summit and surrounding you on all sides are the views of mountains. To the west, take in the Needles, Coliseum, and the majestic Cathedral. To the east, the Fannin Range spotted through the forest earlier, and now in full view. To the south, a delightful view of downtown Vancouver. Continue walking all the way to the northern terminus of the Peak, being mindful of the very steep cliffs on all sides. From the end, the blue waters of Seymour Lake stretch out before you, surrounded by steep, lush forest. Along the way, walk amid pretty tarns scattered along this terrific, rarely visited spot. After enjoying your lunch, begin your descent. You've still got another hour of hiking and an hour of biking left to go as you retrace your steps back down hill to the trailhead before riding back along the Seymour Trailway."
Pender Hill,5.0,Sunshine Coast,Intermediate,1.25,2.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/pender-hill/,"Pender Hill is located on the Sunshine Coast in Pender Harbour and is a short, steep hike that provides incredible views of the surrounding area. From various viewpoints near the top, the views include one looking down towards Hotel Lake, across to Mount Daniel, across Pender Harbour, and out towards the Strait of Georgia. From the parking area, follow the narrow trail next to the sign as you quickly head into the forest. Within a minute, the trail begins to climb quickly as you make your way uphill. Follow the worn path as the ascent becomes steeper, making sure to stay on the trail as there are no trail markers. Eventually, the trail reaches a junction where both routes will rejoin each other about 30-meters up the trail. Go left and follow the path that wraps around the east side, looking up to catch occasional glimpses of a view between the trees. There likely were clear views from this side of the hill at some point but the trees have grown and now block those views. Go left as the trail rejoins the other trail and continue hiking uphill on a more gradual pace. Within minutes, the trails exits from the forest and you walk up over a large rock as you make your way to a bench that sits near the peak of Pender Hill. Continue walking past the peak and down the hill to a viewpoint directly above Hotel Lake that gives you an incredible view looking across the harbour and towards Mount Daniel. From there, you can walk back up slightly and to the west where there is an open area that gives a different view across the harbour and looks out towards the Strait of Georgia. After enjoying and taking photos of the many viewpoints, return to the peak of the hill and follow the worn path back into the forest as you begin your descent. This time, go left at the junction, taking the slightly shorter route back down as it rejoins the trail shortly after. Watch your step as you descend down some of the rocks and steep sections. In no time, the steepness of the descent begins to level and you return to the parking lot area where you began your hike."
Petgill Lake,3.9,Howe Sound,Intermediate,6.0,11.5,March - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/petgill-lake/,"Located along the Sea To Sky Highway near Murrin Provincial Park, the trail climbs steeply up the side of the mountain before disappearing into the forest and reaching the quiet Petgill Lake. Just a 10-minute hike beyond Petgill Lake is a viewpoint that overlooks Howe Sound, Mount Sedgwick behind the old Woodfibre Mill, and the Tantalus Mountain Ranges to the North. From the parking lot at Murrin Provincial Park, carefully cross the highway making sure you wait until there is ample space between vehicles as cars are traveling 80km / h through this section. Walk 100 meters along the gravel section of highway to the left, towards Squamish, and look for an old wooden sign at the start of a steep rocky trail. This marks the trailhead to Petgill Lake. The first section of the trail is a steep scramble as you use your hands to make your way up the side of the mountain next to the highway. The trail enters into the forest and continues to ascend as the sound of traffic becomes fainter. Watch for the orange markers on the trees as the trail dips down into a couple of small ravines, climbs alongside rocky mountain ledges, and passes a couple of viewpoints overlooking Howe Sound below. After hiking uphill for the first 1.5kms, or 30 - 40 minutes, the trail descends quickly and reaches a wide gravel path which is an old logging road. The next section of the hike follows the old road for quite sometime as it starts out relatively flat but then begins to climb through switchbacks through the forest. During the route along the road, the trail crosses 2 creeks, which are sometimes just a trickle of water during the summer months. About 10 - 15 minutes beyond the second creek, the route veers to the left off the road and back onto a trail. At this point the road is completely overgrown and barely recognizable as a road. The trail continues uphill reaching a rocky ridges before dropping down into another ravine and continue uphill once again. For the next 45 minutes the trail goes through another series of ups and downs, including climbing over an open rocky outcrop and descending down a steep narrow trail between huge boulders, challenging the endurance and muscles in your legs. Eventually, the trail begins to level and reaches a junction point. Go left at the junction and a few minutes beyond you are on a rocky ridge above Petgill Lake. You can climb down the rocks or continue along the trail as it descends down near to the lake shore. On a clear day, the more spectacular sight is the viewpoint that is a short 10-minute walk beyond the lake. Continue along the trail as it descends next to the lake to a junction and go left back up a hill towards the viewpoint. The trail curves to the right and an opening in the trees reveals a scenic 180-degree view of Howe Sound, including the Tantalus Mountain Range to the north, Mount Sedgwick directly across, and the area between the viewpoint and the highway south of where you hiked. After finishing your lunch, hike back along the trail towards Petgill Lake and go right at the junction, climbing back up onto the rocky outcrop above the lake before descending back into the forest and onto the trail back towards the trailhead. Retrace your footsteps through the series of ups and downs, back down the old logging road, and eventually down the steep mountain side along the highway, being careful not to lose your grip as you climb over the rocks. Once back alongside the highway, walk south are carefully cross the highway returning back to the Murrin Provincial Park parking lot."
Pitt River Regional Greenway,3.0,Ridge Meadows,Easy,5.0,17.2,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/pitt-river-regional-greenway/,"The Pitt River Regional Greenway is a long trail in Pitt Meadows located along the dikes of the Fraser River where it joins the Pitt River. The route is part of the Trans Canada Trail and this section spans from the area near the Pitt River Bridge to Harris Landing. Since the trail is a flat, gravel path, the greenway is also a popular cycling route. Parking is located at both ends of the trail, however the description starts from the west end of the trail with the suggestion of having lunch at the Pitt Meadows Runway Cafe before walking back (check their hours). The Pitt Meadows airport is located near the Harris Landing area, near the east end of the route. It's about 8km from the parking area to the airport, oneway. From the gravel parking area, walk past the metal gate and up onto the dike, then go left following the trail. The route follows the Pitt River to your right before gradually curving left where the Pitt River joins the Fraser River. Farms to the left provide a sort of peacefulness away from the hustle and bustle of the city. On a clear day, the mountains of Golden Ears Provincial Park provide a scenic backdrop for the rural setting. After the first 5km, the trail reaches a metal gate next to a saw mill. Follow the road in the same direction for about 400-meters until another metal gate marks the start of the next section of gravel trail. Continue following the trail as you near the Pitt Meadows airport. Follow the trail to the left near the airport as it descends down a small hill and passes under a tunnel used by float planes above to connect the airport with the river. Walk another 600-meters and follow a trail to the right that heads out towards the Fraser River, offering a scenic view of the area where shore birds, such as herons, can often be spotted. From this point, you can explore the trails along the shoreline in the Harris Landing park area, head to the cafe at the airport, or start your return trip back to where you began. Make sure to leave plenty of time for the 8km+ that it takes to return back to the parking area."
Pitt Wildlife Loop,3.5,Ridge Meadows,Easy,4.0,15.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/pitt-wildlife-loop/,"The Pitt Wildlife Management Area offers the perfect set of trails for nature lovers and bird watchers as well as those looking for a nice easy walk along the dikes of Pitt Lake. Starting from the Grant Narrows parking lot, walk east past the boat launch area to the metal gate and continue along the Pitt Lake Dike. A short distance after leaving the parking area, you approach a wooden viewing lookout. Climb the stairs to the top and take in the views of Pitt Lake and the marsh area as well as the nature living throughout the area. There are a large variety of animals who live in the Pitt Wilderness Management Area including geese, ducks, Ospreys, Great Blue Herons, eagles, and other mammals such as beavers, deer, and bears. During the late spring, many geese and ducks can be seen protecting their young goslings from predators. During the evening, beavers can occasionally be spotted swimming along the shore of the dikes. Just before reaching the mountains and some buildings, the dike meets with a connecting dike. Some older maps of the area show a trail that goes along the mountains that starts just beyond the buildings, however, these trails have been deactivated years ago and cannot be accessed anymore. However, the dikes are still accessible and offer views just as nice as those along the mountains. Go right onto the Swan Dike and continue along the mountainside. Marsh area surrounds both sides of the dike and many animals have been spotted along the waterways. Continue until you reach a junction. Go right at the junction and continue as you approach the second wooden lookout off in the distance. Just before reaching the lookout is another junction and it is at this point you have to make a decision whether to go right and head back towards the parking lot or left and take the long route that circles the wildlife area. If you want to return to the parking lot, go right towards the lookout tower and continue along the Nature Dike back toward Grant Narrows. For the longer walk, go left and head along the Mountain Dike. Eventually, you reach a dike on the right that continues past a fence with a sign on it. This dike crosses the middle of the marsh and offers a more scenic route than continuing to the farming fields at the southern boundary of the wildlife area. Go right passing through the fence and follow what's called the Homilk'um Dike as it crosses the marsh area. This trail is not as frequently used so you may find yourself making fresh tracks through the tall grass. When the dike meets with a crossing trail, go right and begin heading north towards Pitt Lake. Again, the tall grass covers sections of the trail, however views of the birds and other waterfowl are not obstructed at all. After 40 minutes or so of walking, the trail reaches the road that leads to Grant Narrows. Instead of going right and walking along the dangerous and narrow road, go left for a few hundred meters to a metal gate on the other side of the road. Walk past the gate, up the hill and onto another dike and head to the right as it follows Pitt Lake, eventually arriving back at the parking lot and canoe rental shop."
Porpoise Bay,0.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,0.5,1.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/porpoise-bay/,"Porpoise Bay Provincial Park is located north of Sechelt along the southeastern shores of the Sechelt Inlet. The park has a popular campsite and is a great place for families to explore the beaches along the inlet. The trails in the park are quite short, passing through a beautiful forest area along Angus Creek and crossing over a bridge, heading out onto an estuary with scenic views of Sechelt Inlet. These trails offer a great walk for people of all ages. From the grass field near the playground, follow the gravel trail into the forest and, within minutes, you arrive at a bridge that crosses Angus Creek. Cross the bridge and continue following the trail as it makes its way out of the forest and onto an open estuary. Continue to the end of the trail, admiring the incredible views of the inlet while watching the many birds that frequent the area. Once you?ve enjoyed the view, head back along the same trail, following it back into the forest and back across the bridge. This time, go left and follow the trail along Angus Creek for a bit as it passes through a lush rainforest of moss and Douglas Fir trees. At the first junction, go right and follow the trail as it arrives at a parking lot area. Cross the parking lot and continue on a short connector trail that arrives at an open grass field next to the covered picnic area. Crossing this field returns you to the playground area where you began. You can also continue following the trail along Angus Creek as it will continue to a point near the park entrance."
Quarry Rock,3.9,The North Shore,Easy,1.5,3.8,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/quarry-rock/,"Just off the shores of scenic Deep Cove in North Vancouver sits a large rocky outcrop known as Quarry Rock (also known as Grey Rock in some hiking books). A hiking trail which is also part of the easternmost section of the Baden Powell Trail, leads to this point offering scenic views of Indian Arm and the mountains around Belcarra. The start of the Baden Powell Trail begins along Panorama Drive just beyond the park area. Look for the sign on the left side of the street and walk up the edge of the driveway towards the wooden steps. The first section of the trail climbs quickly up the set of stairs and then up and over the maze of tree roots. The terrain is typical of North Shore hikes; densely wooded areas of Douglas Fir and Hemlock trees, small creeks from mountain runoff, and the smell of fresh forest air. Continue over the small wooden bridge as the trail begins to level. After 30 minutes, the trail heads down towards a large wooden bridge. Cross the bridge and ascend up a set of wooden stairs on the other side. Another 10 minutes and you reach a fork in the trail where the left side goes up a steep embankment. Go right towards the clearing in the trees as the trail climbs up onto the solid rock. You have arrived at the Quarry Rock. Climb up to the highest point to check out the view before staking out a spot to sit and relax. On a warm, clear day, one could sit for hours enjoying the tiny boats below and scenic surroundings off in the distance. When it comes time to return, head back towards the clearing and back along the trail as it weaves through the forest and back towards Deep Cove."
Rainbow Falls Loop,0.0,Whistler,Easy,1.5,2.2,April - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/rainbow-falls-loop/,"The Rainbow Falls waterfall is located in Whistler and a short hike following the trails uphill along Twenty One Mile Creek. While the trail is relatively easy, compared to other hikes, it still gains over 100-metres of elevation and there is a section with tree roots where you will have to be careful as it can be slippery. The falls are scenic and also worth the side trip for those hikers on their way to Rainbow Lake. From the parking area along Alta Lake Road, walk to the left side looking up the creek where the wooden map board is located near the outhouses. Follow the trail as it enters the forest and climbs immediately. The path passes close to a Forestry Service Road, but stay on the path and continue up the hill. Watch for a sign marking the way to Rainbow Falls to the right. Follow the trail to the right as it slightly descends and follows a worn path over tree roots and down towards Twenty One Mile Creek. Continue to the end of the trail, walking towards the sound of the roaring water tumbling over the falls. The water is cold and the canyon gets next to no sunlight, so it's an excellent place to cool off in the summer months. Do not venture too close to the waterfall due to falling rocks and other debris. After enjoying Rainbow Falls, walk back up towards the main trail. You can either return to the parking via the route that you arrived or continue up the hill and loop back down the other side of Twenty One Mile Creek. To complete the loop, follow the main trail uphill. The trail reaches an opening on the Forestry Service Road where there is a sign near a small building. The sign points to Rainbow Lake to the left, however go right and follow the gravel road a short distance and watch for another sign on the right of the road. At the second sign, following the trail down the rocky route to the creek where there is a great view of the water as it rushes over the rocks. Continue along the trail as it heads downhill and passes over a bridge with more views of the creek below. Eventually, the trail reaches another well defined trail. Go right and a short distance later, you exit the forest and arrive back at the parking lot area."
Rainbow Lake,4.2,Whistler,Intermediate,6.0,16.0,July - September,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/rainbow-lake/,"Rainbow Lake is located in Whistler and is one of the area's most scenic and pristine alpine lakes. When timed right in August, the wildflowers around the lake are in full bloom and the views on a clear day are spectacular, with Black Tusk visible in the distance. The trail follows 21 Mile Creek as you pass Rainbow Falls near the beginning and climb gradually through a scenic forested trail. Rainbow Lake is a source of Whistler's drinking water and therefore, swimming in the lake and camping at the lake are NOT permitted. Camping is allowed at Hanging Lake, which is 1.5km beyond Rainbow Lake. From the trailhead along Alta Lake Road, walk past the large map of the area and into the forest as you follow the route next to 21 Mile Creek. The trail gradually climbs until you reach a gravel road. Stay on the trail on the right side of the road, then re-enter the forest on a trail that is just after the road's corner on the right (don't follow the road). A few minutes from the road, you reach a junction where going right takes you to Rainbow Falls. The short side trip is worth the walk as you are offered a great view standing on rocks directly over the falls, peering down at the cold, rushing water below. After enjoying the waterfall, return to the junction and follow the trail uphill until it arrives at the gravel road a short distance later. Cross the road and continue walking straight, passing a building to your right until you reach a sign post that points to a trail to the left called the Flank Trail. Do not follow the Flank Trail, instead go right and follow the wide gravel route uphill as it gradually climbs through the forest with the sounds of 21 Mile Creek below, to your right. Not far up the hill, you pass the first outhouse and then another junction with the Flank Trail. Continue straight, staying on the wide gravel path. At 3km into the hike, you reach a wooden gate with a sign about Whistler's Watershed. At this point, the wide route ends and becomes a narrower hiking trail. Pass the wooden gate and follow the trail uphill along the smooth path into the second generation forest. The forest section is enjoyable as you gradually gain elevation and the trail crosses many small, wooden bridges. Eventually you reach a sign pointing to the second outhouse to the left. A few minutes further along the trail, cross a large cable bridge and walk up the trail as it veers left where there is a view of a waterfall that cascades down from the rocks high above. Continue along the trail as it keeps steadily climbing through the forest until it eventually reaches a series of old, wooden boardwalks that cross a bog. The open bog area provides great views of the surrounding mountains but watch your step on the old wooden slats as many are loose. Note: As of 2014, major trail work is ongoing around this section and it looks as though there will be a new trail that bypasses this route through the bog. There is a new trail junction that is blocked off just beyond the bog area, which will probably join the main trail once it's completed. The completion date is supposed to be by the end of the 2014 season. About 10-minutes after the bog area, the trail reaches a spectacular looking suspension / cable bridge. Cross the bridge and continue along the smooth trail as it begins to emerge from the forest and offer several views of the area, including Rainbow Mountain to your right. The trail winds through a meadow area before going up one final steep section. As the trail levels, Rainbow Lake comes into view. Walk down past the big rock and over the bridge to where the large wooden sign is located. For other great views of the lake, it's worth walking along the path next to the lake to the far end, where you can see the lake on a clear day with Black Tusk towering in the distance. After enjoying your time at Rainbow Lake, retrace your steps back down the trail you came, following the 8km route through the forest, across the many bridges, back to the parking area along Alta Lake Road."
Reifel Bird Sanctuary,5.0,Tsawwassen and Delta,Easy,1.0,5.0,year-round,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/reifel-bird-sanctuary/,"The George C. Reifel Bird Sanctuary is one of the best places in the Vancouver area for bird watching as it's an important location for migratory birds. The sanctuary is located on Westham Island in Delta, BC, and does charge an entrance fee ($5 for adults, $3 for children and seniors as of 2013) but the well maintained trails along the dikes and through the marshland are perfect habit for dozens of species of birds and waterfowl. There are several different trails and routes to take and it's best to plan your route using the sanctuary's map while assuming you will be taking your time as you watch for different birds. The route described below will follow the outer-most trails. From the entrance area, walk along the wide trail and stay right as you usually pass by the ducks looking to be fed. Continue straight along the trail as it narrows and heads west along one of the raised dikes with a waterway on your right and marshland to the left. Along the path, there are several birdhouses on the trees that are used bythe wood ducks for nesting. At the end of this section, the trail splits and two short paths lead to bird blinds, small wooden huts with latched doors that open so you can peer out and look for birds without them noticing movement. Take your time here but be sure to enter and leave the bird blinds quietly to not disturb others who are bird-watching. Continue along the trail as it now heads south where it joins with several other trails and an observation tower a short distance later. The observation tower is the highest viewpoint in the area and offers a great 360-degree view. After enjoying the view, walk back to the junction and trail where you came from and continue in the same direction heading south towards the outer most trail. This trail heads out towards the north western most point and wraps around on a raised dike along the western side, offering views out towards the Strait of Georgia. This is where binoculars come in handy as there are often flocks of birds in the distance out towards the shoreline or amongst the brush on both sides of the path. Continue walking along the section of trail at your own pace and pass the junction with the trail on the left. A short distance later, you reach a metal gate marking the sanctuary's boundary. Go left and back inland along the the marsh's on both sides of the trail. A short distance later, you reach a junction with another trail. To return to the sanctuary's entrance, go right and after a few minutes walk, you'll reach the main trail near the entrance. If you would like to extend your day, walking around the inland marsh area is a great place to see more birds. Go left and take the first trail on your right. The network of trails will look around the inland marsh area and bring you back onto the outer main trails."
Rice Lake,3.9,The North Shore,Easy,1.0,3.0,year-round,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/rice-lake/,"Rice Lake is a calm, quiet lake located on the edge of the Lynn Headwaters Regional Park in North Vancouver. Just a short walk takes you around this lake that is full of life and natural beauty. From the gravel parking lot north of Capilano College, walk past the park ranger buildings towards the grassy picnic area. Just on the other side of the grassy clearing is a gravel trail that enters into the forest. Follow this wide dirt road a short distance until you reach a wooden fence marking the entrance to the Rice Lake area. Continue along the path towards Rice Lake admiring the trees and moss-covered forest floor that surrounds you. Just a few more steps and the forest opens to a view of Rice Lake. Turn right and walk along the trail that weaves alongside the lake. There are several viewpoints around the lake with benches to relax and take in the natural beauty of the area. Long-legged herons and a wide variety of colourful ducks are active around the lake. Occasionally, an eagle can be spotted circling high above. The Rice Lake area is a great area for bird watchers and those who just enjoy the relaxing sounds. Only a short distance later brings you back to the wooden information board where you started walking around the lake. Go right back towards the wooden gate and turn left onto the gravel road to make your way back towards the ranger station and parking lot where you began."

A scenic viewpoint is located on the west side of the lake where beavers can sometimes be spotted. From the map board and metal gate along Shingle Bay Road, follow the wide trail as it gradually climbs through the forest. The forest consistent of a variety of second growth douglas fir and cedar trees. When the trail reaches a junction, this is the point where the loop around the lake begins. Go left and begin walking in a clockwise direction around Roe Lake. The trail weaves its way through the forest and has several short uphill and downhill sections, all of which are pretty easy. Occasional views of Roe Lake can be seem through openings in the tree cover. Stay on the trail that wraps around the lake. At the far end of the lake, the trail briefly goes uphill before sharply veering right. Continue walking and, when the trail descends, watch for a short path to the left that goes through a beautiful forest for a view of the nearby marsh. Return to the trail and continue as you begin to walk along the west side. Eventually, there is a junction with a short trail to the right that goes to a scenic viewpoint of Roe Lake. After enjoying the viewpoint, return to the main trail and, a short distance further, you reach the junction where you began your loop around Roe Lake.

Roesland,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,0.5,1.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/roesland/,"Roesland is located on North Pender Island and is part of the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. The park has a short trail on an Islet that passes several Arbutus trees and provides scenic views of the Salish Sea and the passing boats. It's a great place to take kids to play near the water or have a picnic. Roesland was originally a farm before being converted to a resort that operated from the 1920's until 1990. Several of the buildings are still standing and can be explored. The Pender Islands Museum is located in an old house and is generally open on weekends. It's a short walk form the parking lot down the gravel path to the museum and buildings. Just beyond the buildings is a small beach area. Walk to the right side, down the steps and cross over to the stairs that go up to the trail on the Islet. Follow the trail through the trees, catching glimpses of the water and some of the birds that frequent the area. The trail eventually reaches a bench. Climb over the rocks to where the end of the Islet is, offering scenic shoreline views. The BC Ferries can be seen passing by, including the large ferry connecting Vancouver to Victoria and the ferries that arrive at Otter Bay on Pender Island. Walk back along the trail to the area of Roesland where the buildings are. There are some other areas along the water you can explore before heading back up the gravel trail to the parking lot."
Rohr Lake,5.0,Pemberton,Difficult,6.0,10.0,July - September,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/rohr-lake/,"Rohr Lake is a beautiful, turquoise coloured lake situated in the alpine area between Pemberton and Lillooet. The hike to the lake follows the route to the Marriot Basin before branching off and heading up a very steep boulder field, offering incredible views along the rocky section. This route stops at Rohr Lake but hikers can continue on towards Mount Rohr, making for a very long day-hike. This would add an additional 7km total and about 500m of additional elevation. The route to Rohr Lake begins alongside Highway 99 across from the Salt Shed. However, there is access via a Forest Service Road (FSR) on the North side of the Highway just west of the Salt Shed. This is the same FSR that you will hike along but the road has several spots that are meant for vehicles with higher clearance. If you are able to drive up to one of the four parking areas, it will cut down the amount of hiking distance. Refer to the Directions section below. From the parking along Highway 99, walk along the highway in the direction towards Pemberton and look for a small trail that heads into the bushes. Follow this trail a short distance until it reaches a clearing next to the FSR where there are often cars parked. This is the first parking area along the FSR. Walk up the FSR, following the gravel road as it gradually climbs. You will pass a 2nd clearing on the left where more cars can park. Just after the 2nd parking area, stay on the main road to the left as you pass a spur to the right that goes up hill to a dead end. A short distance further and you pass a 3rd clearing where vehicles can park. Continue following the road for about another 1km as you quickly make time along this easy section of the route. The FSR will eventually reach the 4th and final clearing for parking where only vehicles with a higher clearance can reach. From the final parking area, the FSR ends and becomes a trail. Follow the trail into the forest as it makes its way over wooden planks, across streams, and through muddy sections. After a couple hundred metres, the trail starts to climb through the forest as you gain elevation. After hiking for about 45-minutes, you reach the junction with signs on a tree that point to the Wendy Thompson Hut to the left and Rohr to the right. Go right and continue following the trail uphill as it passes through a couple of very muddy bogs. The trail will eventually reach a clearing with a meadow. Watch for markers and flagging tape to the right and follow the route uphill through the trees. The steep boulder field begins at the next clearing. Stay to the right of the boulder field and watch for trail markers and flagging tape as you make your way up the steep slope. Watch your step through the mud and boulders as a stream of water is often flowing down the rocks on or near the trail route, making the hike difficult and treacherous in some sections. After a short reprieve from the steepness, the trail veers left and continues up the boulders while offering sweeping views of the valley and the area around the Marriot Basin. Continue to follow the trail up the boulder field until it ends just steps from Rohr Lake. Walk towards the shore of the lake for the first views of the turquoise coloured water. There is a rocky beach area a short walk to the right, offering a scenic view of the lake and the rugged slope on the south shore. There are also several other viewpoints along Rohr Lake, including one at the far end (eastern end) of the lake that are worth seeing. Follow the trail to the left along the lake as it gradually makes its way up onto some rocks where you will be treated to a view of Rohr Lake. If you are not planning to continue to Mount Rohr, return via the same route you arrived. Follow the trail back down the boulder field, being very careful to watch your footing as you make your way down the slippery rocks and mud. Watch for flagging tape and follow the trail into the forest as it descends back down to the meadow area. Once you've made it to the meadow, the return is a little easier. Continue to follow the trail into the forest as you descend quickly and pass through the two muddy bogs, eventually returning to the junction. Go left and downhill until the trail begins to level and you cross the wooden planks, returning to the Forest Service Road. Follow the road back down to where you parked and began your hike."
Rolley Lake,3.8,Fraser Valley East,Easy,2.0,5.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/rolley-lake/,"Rolley Lake is a small lake located northwest of the town of Mission. In the summer, it's a popular day use and camping area complete with picnic tables, a small beach area, and a children's playground. Therefore, the summer months are often packed with families, so it's best to go in the early spring or during the fall to enjoy a nice peaceful walk on a cool, crisp day. During the late fall and winter season the park is generally closed so you will have to park on the paved road and walk down the wide gravel road towards the lake. Begin your hike from the lowermost parking lot next to the lake. Head to the left to begin walking clockwise around the lake. The trail briefly enters a forest before reaching a fork. Continue to the right down the slight hill towards the lake and onto a wooden boardwalk that crosses a marsh area. From here, you can see the peaceful lake or get a glimpse of the crowds using it across from the main beach area. Continue along the boardwalk as it crosses the lake and enters back into the forest. Tree branches are draped and the forest floor is carpeted by a layer of green moss which flourishes in the moist surroundings. The trail continues through second growth Cedar and Hemlock trees as it hugs the shore of Rolley Lake offering occasional views through the trees. Once you reach a bridge that crosses over the rushing Rolley Creek, you are faced with the option of going left or right. Go left and follow the wide trail as it heads gradually uphill until reaching the campsite a short time later. Just a few steps further past the outhouse is another trail which leads towards the Rolley Falls Loop. Follow this trail until you reach a fork and go right as it heads down the side of the mountain. At the bottom, watch for a trail on the left and follow this as it winds through a few short switchbacks to a forestry service road. Walk towards the road and cross the bridge, observing the falls on your left. Look for the start of a trail just past the falls and follow this trail as it heads up a steep hill alongside the creek. A short distance up you arrive at a small wooden viewing platform which offers the best views of the lower falls as they tumble into the canyon below. After taking in the view, continue back up the trail alongside the falls as it heads back into the trees and arrives at another bridge a short time later. Here is the smaller upper falls. To return to Rolley Lake, cross the bridge and head up the gradual hill a short distance where it arrives at the fork you passed earlier. Go right and a few steps later you're back at the outhouse and the trail that heads back down towards the lake on the right. Head back down the trail and pass the bridge without crossing it again. The trail continues alongside the shore as you make your way back towards the beach area where you began."

The short Ruckle Loop takes you to a scenic viewpoint but other trails in the park can be combined with this walk to extend your day hike. From the day-use parking lot, walk across the grass field towards a picnic table where there is a sign and trail that heads into the forest. Follow the trail into the forest as it makes its way around the coastline, offering glimpses of the view as you walk. It's a short walk and you will soon pass a junction and exit the forest. Continue to follow the trail as it heads out onto the point, passing several Arbutus trees, before reaching the end with a scenic view of Swanson Channel. Several ferry routes pass by, so it's likely you will see the Vancouver - Victoria ferry or one of the Gulf Island Ferries pass by. After enjoying the view, walk back towards the forest. You can extend your hike by continuing along the coastline or you can loop back to the parking area. To head back, you can either walk the same trail you arrived or take the other trail at the junction you passed, which is a slightly longer route through a scenic forest. One other area of note to explore is you can access the beach area near the grass field by the day-use parking lot via a trail near the picnic table that goes downhill to the beach."
Sargeant Bay,0.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,0.25,0.8,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/sargeant-bay/,"Sargeant Bay Provincial Park is located on the Sunshine Coast and is a popular scenic beach area to visit. The trail is very short and is primarily used to access the beach area along the bay. The trail begins at the end of the parking lot next to a wooden map board of the area. Follow the wide, gravel trail as it parallels the beach area, offering views looking out into the bay. As you walk, there is a marsh to the left of the trail and can offer a good vantage for bird watchers. The trail ends at a bridge with a small set of fish ladders, which are used by returning salmon, making their way from the salt water up Colvin Creek. Note that the large rock at the end of the trail is private property and no trespassing is allowed. For those looking for a much longer hike, the northern section of Sergeant Bay Provincial Park goes all the way toTriangle Lake. There is a trail from the parking lot at Sergeant Bay that follows the driveway up to Redrooffs Road before crossing the road and continuing for about 3.4km to Triangle Lake."
Sasamat Lake,4.1,Tri Cities,Easy,1.0,3.2,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/sasamat-lake/,"Hikers looking for an easy, year-round accessible hike or an outdoor area perfect for family picnics and a short walk will find the trails around Sasamat Lake in Belcarra Park a great escape from the city. Located near Port Moody, Sasamat Lake has several facilities including walking trails, a beach area, swimming in the lake, a concession stand, and much more. In the summer, Sasamat Lake can become very busy so it is advised to arrive early if you expect to find a parking spot near the lake. The trail wraps around the lake so you can choose what area you would like to begin your walk however, we will start from the White Pine Beach area by the concession stand. As you walk down the short hill towards the beach, the lake comes into full view giving a sense of the entire area and the distance around the lake. Go right towards the end of the beach area where the paved trail turns to gravel and heads into the forest. We will walk around the lake in a counterclockwise direction. For the first section the well maintained trail hugs the shoreline offering occasional glimpses of the lake from different angles. As you continue, the trails goes up a set of wooden stairs and merges with the gravel road above. Follow this road to the left towards the Sasamat Outdoor Club, a facility that offers many outdoor programs for community groups and local schools within the Belcarra Park area. Cross the driveway and walk down the steps as the trail continues toward Bedwell Bay Road. After crossing a bridge over a small stream, the trail reaches a junction. Walking right takes you to Woodhaven Swamp and going left will continue along the trail that circles the lake. Go right as the trail follows Bedwell Bay Road for a short distance before going up a set of wooden stairs to the road. Carefully cross the road to the sign on the other side and continue up the trail between the two residential houses. As the trail climbs up the side of the hill, the sight of homes and noises of passing cars and the busy Sasamat Lake area begin to fade. The trail is well maintained and easy to follow through the second-generation of Douglas Fir and Western Cedar trees. After hiking for 2km, the trail arrives at another small road with the Woodhaven Swamp partially visible between the trees on the other side. Cross the road and continue along the trail to a sign on the left. Walk down the steps and follow the path as it loops around the swamp area. After enjoying the scenery, return to the road area and cross back to the trail that leads back down towards Sasamat Lake. Once back at the junction near Bedwell Bay Road, continue along the trail that wraps around Sasamat Lake. The terrain is flat and there are several viewpoints to stop and enjoy the mountain peaks that overlook the Belcarra region in the background. Eventually, the trail arrives at a crossing on the south end of the lake which has a couple of platforms for swimmers. Walk across this crossing and take in the view of the lake. Once on the other side of the lake, continue along the trail to the left back towards the White Pine Beach area. Only a short time later, the trail opens up at the beach area and you have completed your loop of Sasamat Lake. A hot, sunny day offers the perfect opportunity for a quick dip in the lake or a relaxing picnic on the sandy beach shore."
Sea To Summit Trail,4.4,Howe Sound,Intermediate,3.5,7.5,March - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/sea-to-summit-trail/,"The Sea To Summit Trail in Squamish, BC, is a steep hiking trail that begins at the bottom of the Sea To Sky Gondola and finishes at the lodge at the top. Formerly known as the Upper Shannon Falls Trail, the route passes a couple of sweeping views of Howe Sound and the top section of Shannon Falls offering much more than a good workout. The trail begins underneath the Gondola at the far end of the gravel parking lot but hikers can also start from the overflow parking lot and hike past Shannon Falls along the Connector Trail. The trail is very well marked with Sea To Summit signs, so make sure to keep following those signs on the trees. Please ensure to either have a pass or bring money to purchase a ticket to take the Gondola back down after your hike. From the parking lot, cross the bridge and follow the trail up the short hill to a junction that joins with the Connector Trail. Go left and follow the path as you gradually climb uphill. The sound of water rushing down Olesen Creek can be heard up ahead as you approach and before long, you climb up onto a wooden bridge over the creek. After crossing the bridge, the trail joins with the trail toThe Chieffor a brief section. Go right and begin the steep uphill hike up the wooden stairs with the rushing water to your right. This section is steep and often quite busy with plenty of hikers heading up to enjoy the views on the Chief. Continue hiking uphill and watch for a sign marking a junction. Go right at the junction as you leave the trail to the Chief and continue following the Sea To Summit route. The trail offers a reprieve for awhile as you follow a flat section to a wooden bridge, crossing back over Olesen Creek before continuing along the easiest section of the hike. Just after passing the 1/4 way marker, things go back to being steep and difficult. The trail veers left and up some old, wooden steps, continuing a steep ascent through the forest. After hiking uphill, the trail reaches a clearing where the Gondola passes overhead. After waving at the passing people, continue hiking back in the forest along a section that descends gradually before the trail turns left again and heads up a steep hill. The first section of hill isn't too bad but then it gets very steep, with scrambling required and one section where you have to pull yourself over a challenging, large rock. Just after climbing up and over this rock, walk to the right and up onto the rocky bluff for a small view of Howe Sound. Continue following the Sea To Summit Trail as it passes through a section of gradual ups and downs, quickly gaining you time and distance. The sound of the falls up ahead gets closer as the trail passes next to the rushing water and you use a chain to pull yourself up the rocks nearby. Do not venture too close or into the water as you are at the top of Shannon Falls at this point. Follow the trail as you pass through a lush forest and continue hiking uphill. Just after passing the 1/2 way marker, you arrive at a rocky clearing with an incredible view of Howe Sound. This is a great location to stop for awhile for a snack and soak in the view, one of the best in the region. After a short break, follow the markers up the rock section, then drop back onto the dirt trail and back into the forest. The next section is mostly uphill but not as steep as some of the previous sections. Eventually, you'll arrive at, what looks like, a rugged forestry road. Go left and following the route, crossing a small creek before heading uphill. At a junction and sign post on the left, go left towards the Lodge as you have 2.3km still to hike. Make up time on the flat section before turning right and heading uphill. The trail again passes under the Gondola as, this time, you use a rope to pull yourself up the smooth rock. Continue along the hiking trail, through the forest as you have less than 1km to go. At a clearing, a glimpse of the lodge can be seen, before dipping back into the forest and hiking the final section out of the forest to the top of the gondola."
Semaphore Lakes,4.0,Pemberton,Intermediate,3.0,6.8,July - October,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/semaphore-lakes/,"The hiking trail to Semaphore Lakes is located north of Pemberton, BC, and has incredible views of Face Mountain and Locomotive Mountain. There are several waterfalls that drop from the nearby mountains and from Train Glacier into the area near the three lakes, making for some beautiful alpine scenery. The hike to Semaphore Lakes is relatively short and not a lot of elevation gain for an alpine hike as most of the elevation gained is done driving up the Hurley FSR to the start of the trail. There are three lakes that make up Semaphore Lakes and a longer hike / scramble can be done to Locomotive Mountain. From the trailhead along the Hurley, drop down onto the trail and follow the markers through the trees. After a short distance, the trail begins to climb through the well defined route as you rapidly gain elevation. The trail briefly levels as you pass a meadow on the right. As you continue your hike, the trees begin to thin while the trail continues to ascend. When the trail reaches a junction, go to the right as this route will wrap around the mountain and take you directly to the first lake, avoiding extra elevation gain. The trail continues ascending at a gradual pace as you pass through alpine vegetation until you begin to see the view of the Semaphore Lakes area. The view at the first lake is awe inspiring with Locomotive Mountain towering high above on the other side of the valley. Continue walking along the trail as it passes the second and third lakes, both with scenic views of their own. There are plenty of places to stop for lunch to enjoy the view but one of the areas that is beautiful is close to the river where you get a view of the mountains and can look down the valley. After enjoying Semaphore Lakes, make your way back, passing each of the lakes and following the trail around the mountain until it reaches the junction. Go left and head downhill, passing the meadow, and carefully hiking back down the steeper section until you reach the trailhead where you began."
Sendero Diez Vistas,3.9,Tri Cities,Intermediate,6.0,15.0,April - November,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/sendero-diez-vistas/,"Named Diez Vistas for its ten views, this hike offers beautiful scenery overlooking Indian Arm as you make your way around the Buntzen Lake area. The hike begins from the north end of the main Buntzen Lake parking lot. Follow the Buntzen Lake Trail southbound to the southernmost end of the lake and cross a floating bridge through a marshy area. Once on the other side continue straight past the Diez Vistas sign, crossing the service road that goes left then right before beginning the climb uphill. The trail meanders through the forest as you slowly make your way uphill eventually coming to a clearing with power lines above. Continue straight and after walking another 10 minutes, a series of switchbacks begin. This is the steepest part of the hike. After passing through the switchbacks, you will be treated to your first view of Sasamat Lake and Belcarra Regional Park with Burnaby and Vancouver off in the distance. Take a break here before continuing up the much less steep hill to the second viewpoint that overlooks Buntzen Lake and the busy beach area below. Once you have taken in the second view, continue along the trail as it makes its way up and down through the forest until reaching the third viewpoint. This is probably the best view that overlooks much of Indian Arm with a clear view of Deep Cove directly ahead and downtown Vancouver off to the left in the distance. On the other side of Indian Arm, towering high above the water are the three visible peaks of Mount Seymour. From this point the trail continues along the ridge with occasional views of Indian Arm and the houses along the west side. Some viewpoints are better than others as the foliage has grown over the years. The hike weaves its way through forested areas and gradually descends back downhill until you reach a gravel road. At the gravel road, turn right and walk a short distance towards the north end of Buntzen Lake. From here, turn right and walk along the Buntzen Lake Trail for 10-15 minutes before heading down a steep gravel section where there is a trail that forks to the left, almost heading back in the direction parallel to where you came. Take this trail and you will reach the suspension bridge that crosses the north section of the lake to the much quieter beach on the other side. After completing the Diez Vistas Trail on a hot day, this area is perfect for a cool, refreshing dip into the lake. It's only a 40-minute walk back to the parking lot where you began your day. Continue past the beach towards the huge drain and make your way up the steep hill to the dirt road. At the top take the path as it continues along the eastern shore of Buntzen Lake, crossing small streams and offering occasional glimpses of the lake and surrounding mountains. The sound of dogs barking and children playing in the water means you're almost there! On a hot day, take a dip in the lake before heading back to the parking lot to end your hike."
Serpentine Fen Nature Trail,2.5,Surrey and Langley,Easy,1.5,3.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/serpentine-fen-nature-trail/,"The Serpentine Fen in Surrey offers a scenic walk through a nature reserve with three wooden towers with great views of the area. The nature reserve is popular with bird watchers as more than 100 different species frequent the area depending on the time of year. The best place to start this loop is from a gravel parking area on the side of King George Blvd, just north of 44th Avenue. From the parking lot, walk west along the dyke, past the metal gate, and follow the trail to where you see a large map of the area next to a junction with a trail. This is the point where you will return to after completing the, roughly, 3km loop. After looking at the map, continue walking along the dyke trail as you reach the first wooden viewing tower within about 10-minutes. Climb the stairs to the top and you will be treated to a scenic view of the area and maybe able to spot some of the many birds in the nature reserve. Continue walking along the dyke trail as it waves a few times before following a long, straight stretch. At the first opportunity to go left, walk down the gravel trail to the second wooden viewing tower and climb to the top of the stairs for another view of the park area. After enjoying another view, continue on the trail leading away from the dyke and follow it as it begins to loop back and to the left. After 15 - 20 minutes, watch for a small wooden bridge on your left and walk over it to where the third wooden viewing tower is located. This is the last tower of the three towers. Complete the loop by following the narrow trail, crossing a couple of small bridges, then following the trail along the marsh area to a final wooden bridge, then the map of the area where you passed earlier. Turn right and walk the short distance along the dyke trail, back to the parking lot."
Seton Lake Lookout,5.0,Pemberton,Easy,0.5,1.0,May - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/seton-lake-lookout/,"The Seton Lake Lookout is a short hike to a popular viewpoint that looks out to Seton Lake with a U-shaped portion of the Sea To Sky Highway in the foreground. The trail is located just south of the town of Lillooet, just off the Duffey Lake Road portion of the Sea To Sky Highway. From the gravel parking area, carefully cross the Sea To Sky Highway to the path on the opposite side. Be very careful crossing the highway as vehicles are often traveling quickly through the downhill section. Once on the other side of the highway, follow the trail along a flat section as it passes a few trees then nears a viewpoint on the left. Just beyond this viewpoint, the trail climbs quickly for a short distance until it meets a flat section, which appears to be an old dirt road. Go left and follow the wide route as it gradually ascends until it reaches a rocky section. Climb up onto the rock, then follow the worn path up the slow, being careful of the drop-offs on each side. Once at the top, you have reached the scenic viewpoint where you can see the entire U-Shaped section of the highway as well as Seton Lake. After enjoying the view, carefully make your way back down the rocks and follow the trail back downhill.

Seven Sisters Trail,3.5,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,3.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/seven-sisters-trail/,"The Seven Sisters Trail is a short hike in the Cultus Lake area to a grove of old-growth douglas fir trees. There once were ""seven"" of the enormous trees, however as they reach their elder years, some have fallen and there are only three that remain standing today. The trees are located within a small loop and their sheer size are impressive. The trail can either be started from the Entrance Bay Campground or the Clear Creek Campground. This description explains how to reach the trail starting from the Entrance Bay Campground as day-use visitors can park in the nearby Entrance Bay Picnic Area parking lot. The trailhead is a bit tricky to find as it starts up the hill, inside the Entrance Bay Campground along the access road. Walk up the paved road and watch for a sign on your right side marking the beginning of the trail. Begin your hike as the trail heads uphill quickly and into the forested area. The trail passes through a 2nd generation growth forest, lush with greenery and lichen. Cross a small wooden bridge and continue hiking as the trail weaves its way up and around a small hill. Only a short distance later and you reach some wooden boardwalks and a BC Parks sign with information about the trees. This marks the beginning of the small loop as you are standing next to the first of three ""Seven Sisters"" that are still standing. Walk up the wooden steps to your left as it follows next to one of the fallen trees. Continue walking around the short look, looking for the huge douglas fir trees. Once you return to the point where you began, you can walk back to the Entrance Bay Campground the same way that you arrived. The path that goes off in the other direction takes you to the Clear Creek Campground. Note that there is no path that connects the two campgrounds near the lake and you would have to walk back alongside the road, which is not recommended. If you are looking for a longer hike, you can connect to theTeapot Hilltrail by following the trail towards the Clear Creek Campground and going left at a junction just before the campground. This will take you along a trail that connects to the beginning of the Teapot Hill trail."
Shadow Lake,1.0,Pemberton,Easy,2.0,5.0,June - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/shadow-lake/,"Hundreds of cars pass along the highway between Whistler and the town of Pemberton daily but very few stop to see Shadow Lake which is hidden from view less than a 100 meters from the road. Park at the Shadow Lake parking lot next to the highway and take a look at the map of the area. If you are just looking for a very short walk, take the trail behind the sign through the Shadow Lake Interpretive Forest. Seeing the marshy shores of Shadow Lake surrounded by mountainous views is the real reward of this area. Walk across the highway to get to the trailhead. Be careful as traffic speeds in this area are quite high. Make your way down the trail keeping to your left. You will come upon a wider access road and a couple of cabins. Stay off of private property but continue down the access road to the bottom and head left along the trail. After a short walk you will hit a fork in the trail. Go left and continue a short distance where you will see Shadow Lake beyond the marshes off to your right. Upon coming to another fork in the trail, head left to a viewpoint along the Green River Trail. The trail starts out flat but then heads uphill towards the train tracks before eventually reaching the viewpoint. Take in the view before heading back to the Shadow Lake Loop. Continue left along the Shadow Lake Trail passing over a couple of wooden bridges before eventually reaching another fork in a road. Head left for a short 15-minute loop that takes you through old growth forest. After passing by an old wooden shed, you will be back where you started at the beginning of the old growth forest loop. Stay to your left and continue along the Shadow Loop. Another short distance and you have completed the Shadow Lake Loop. Head back towards the wide access road that you walked down at the beginning but before heading back up to the highway and parking lot, walk to your left 30 meters to the clearing for a view of the Soo River."
Shannon Falls,0.0,Howe Sound,Easy,0.5,1.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/shannon-falls/,"The iconic Shannon Falls in Squamish, BC, is a towering waterfall that is visible along the Sea To Sky Highway and is one of the town's most recognizable features. Visitors to Shannon Falls Provincial Park can walk the short distance to a spectacular viewpoint below the falls, then continue to a second viewpoint further up the trail. Starting from the parking lot, walk towards the park area where all of the picnic tables are located and walk past the building with the washrooms. Veer left and begin walking up hill as the path turns into a gravel trail. Go straight at the first junction and continue along the gravel path as you enter the forest and continue walking next to the scenic Shannon Creek. The route goes up a short hill, then reaches a paved path. Go right and, as you continue to walk towards the sound of the roaring falls, the entire waterfall comes into view. This first viewpoint is an excellent place to get some photos and selfies before continuing to the next viewpoint. To get to the upper viewpoint, walk back along the paved path and look for a trail on the right where wooden stairs head up into the forest. Follow this trail as it climbs steadily, continuing up a number of stairs. As the trail begins to level, Shannon Falls comes into view via a slightly different angle. After enjoying the second viewpoint, walk back down the stairs and through the forest until you returned to the paved section. Instead of returning back down the gravel trail, you can go to the right and follow the paved path as it veers left before joining the original route that you walked.

Shoreline Trail,4.4,Tri Cities,Easy,2.0,6.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/shoreline-trail/,"Located along the shores of Burrard Inlet, Rocky Point Park in Port Moody is one of the most scenic parks in the lower mainland. The Shoreline Trail is an easy walking route that wraps around the eastern most section of Burrard Inlet, starting from the pier at Rocky Point Park and ending at Old Orchard Park. From the parking lot, walk out onto the pier next to the boat launch and enjoy the surrounding view. On a sunny weekend day, the water can be quite busy with motorboats, kayakers, and dragon-boaters. After enjoying the view walk back to the start of the pier and go left along the trail that follows the shoreline and passes through the grassy park area to the right. After walking over the second bridge, the gravel trail begins as you begin to leave the sound of kids playing at the water park. Walk onto the gravel trail on the left side as this trail will stay close to the shore and is not meant for cyclists. The trail passes through a nice forested area, offering glimpses of the inlet to the left, before descending down a set of long wooden steps and opening to a clearing. This is where the narrow wooden boardwalks are located as you make your way across while taking in the view towards the inlet. After crossing the boardwalks, the gravel trail continues for a short distance before reaching the second series of raised platforms. Walk across these and then cross the wooden bridge at the end. After the bridge, go left, up a short hill, and continue following the narrow gravel trail along the shoreline. Eventually, the trail opens up into a clearing and you reach a junction on the left. This area was the old McNair Cedar Mill, which burned down in 1949. You may notice some remnants of equipment along the trail along with posts and dock pilings along the shore from the viewpoint. Back on the trail, continue your walk as you reach a junction. Go left and down a few wooden steps as the trail continues to weave it's way along the shore. Not too much further and you reach Old Orchard Park with picnic tables, a playground, and a small beach area. This is a good place to stop for a rest before walking back along the trail to Rocky Point."
Skookumchuck Narrows,4.7,Sunshine Coast,Easy,2.0,8.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/skookumchuck-narrows/,"Skookumchuck Narrows is a popular attraction on the Sunshine Coast where the powerful rapids and whirlpools of the changing tidal waters can be seen that flow between Jervis Inlet and Sechelt Inlet. The trail is about 8km roundtrip and passes through a scenic west coast rainforest before reaching the viewpoints at either North Point or Roland Point. These rapids are a fairly unique occurrence as the water flow can reach speeds of 30km/h as about 200 billion gallons of water passes through the narrows during a tide change. The best viewing times are when the tides change at their peak times. During the peak low tide, Sechelt Inlet floods and the best rapids can be viewed from Roland Point. During the peak high tide, known as the ebb tide, the water leaves Sechelt Inlet and the best whirlpools can be seen from North Point. It is recommended to check a tide table for the times of day when these changes occur and plan enough time to hike in to see them. The trail begins from a parking area next to the road near the community of Egmont, BC. Walk down the gravel road that passes the wooden BC Parks sign with a map of the area and continue across the bridge. The start of the route follows a road past several houses that is only accessible to local traffic. Please ensure to stay off private property in the area. After walking for about 10-15 minutes, the road reaches a metal gate on the right side with a sign that marks the beginning of the trail portion to Skookumchuck Narrows. Follow this trail as you quickly enter a scenic west coast rainforest, rich in moss, sword ferns, cedar trees, and Douglas fir trees. When the trail arrives at Brown Lake, you will have have crossed the boundary and entered Skookumchuck Narrows Provincial Park. Enjoy the views of the lake as you continue hiking along the trail. Just after the trail leaves the lake area, it veers right and begins to descend, continuing through the beautiful forest. The trail reaches the junction where you can go left to North Point or right to Roland Point. The trail to North Point takes just a few minutes but the trail to Roland Point is a bit longer and takes about 10-minutes to walk each direction. If you are timing it to see one of the tide changes, the view of the whirlpools is best at North Point when it's peak high and the view of the rapids is best at Roland Point during peak low tides. The view from North Point is set on some rocks, higher up and looks across the narrow waterway. Hikers can sit on a single bench or along the rocks to enjoy the view. The area is surrounded by a fence to prevent anyone from venturing too near the dangerous whirlpools. The view from Roland Point is closer to the water and more open. There is not an obvious place to sit but plenty of space to enjoy the views of the rapids. You can get right next to the water but please ensure to not venture too close as the currents are very strong during the tidal changes. After enjoying the views of the area, hike back along the trail in the direction you arrived, passing the junction and heading up the gradual hill through the forest. Pass Brown Lake and continue to enjoy the calmness and smells of the forest. Once back at the gravel road, follow it back towards the parking area as you cross back over the bridge and make the final few steps of your return."
Skyline Trail,3.6,The North Shore,Intermediate,3.0,5.0,April - November,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/skyline-trail/,"The hike along the Skyline Trail begins from the top of Skyline Drive in North Vancouver and ends at the bottom of the chairlift of ""The Cut"" ski run on Grouse Mountain. There are several pieces of interesting history along this trail as the route follows the old chairlift that used to go up to Grouse Mountain before the Gondola was built, passes several old cabins that are no longer standing, and is also the site of a US Airforce F-86 Sabre Jet crash that happened in 1954. The hike itself is very steep and essentially goes straight up the mountain, but there is an incredible view of Vancouver from the ski run at the top on a sunny day. A note about the plane crash, the only remaining significant piece of the jet is an engine which has been made into a memorial for the pilot, Second Lt. Lamar J. Barlow, who was killed in the crash. The engine sits in a beautiful part of the forest, which is located to the east of the Skyline Trail but is not easy to find (see directions below). From the parking area, walk up the paved road, past the metal gate and continue following the road as it curves its way up the mountain. The wider, open area that you pass through was the parking lot for the old chairlift to Grouse Mountain. Continue walking past the old parking lot, onto the gravel road and follow it as it again curves left. Several meters after the curve is a sign that points to the Baden Powell ahead and the Skyline Trail to the right. This is when the trail gets steep. Go right and begin hiking up the steep, rocky trail as it climbs relentlessly. Along the trail, there will be several pieces of the old chairlift, including some wheels and posts, that have been left as a memory to the once busy area before the Gondola was built. The trail continues climbing and the terrain does not change much all the way to the top! If you want to visit the site of the plane crash, there are several opportunities to know when to veer off the trail to look for the jet engine. First, there is an old cabin that has collapsed and is located just off the trail to the right. While it's visible from the trail, it's really easy to miss. If you see the cabin, you can walk up to it and follow a trail that is not marked to the east where it will curve northward, before heading up a short distance further to where the jet engine lies on your right. It is also easy to miss the jet engine as you keep an eye on where you are walking and not on your surroundings. The second opportunity to find the jet engine is a small, yellow ribbon tied to a tree, marking a trail that heads eastward. This is located after the old cabin and following this trail will meet with another trail within a few minutes. Go right and walk down the second trail and within a minute, the jet engine should be on the left. The final opportunity is probably the easiest to find. When the Skyline Trail reaches a 4-way junction, leave the Skyline Trail and go right to where the trail immediately comes to a clearing. Continue straight through the clearing and at the far end, the trail begins again but descends down the mountain. The walk down should take no more than 5 minutes and the jet engine will be on the left of the trail. To return to the Skyline Trail from the jet engine, follow the unmarked trail uphill for about 5-minutes until it reaches a clearing. Walk through the clearing to a 4-way junction. The trail going left and right is the Skyline Trail. Go right and continue hiking to the top, which is not much further. The Skyline Trail ends at the chairlift but on a clear, sunny day, it is recommended to walk up the ski run to at least the height of the trees at the bottom for an incredible view of Vancouver. Continue to the Grouse Mountain Gondola For those wanting to continue to the Grouse Mountain Gondola from the bottom of The Cut, there is a trail to the left (west) of the chairlift known as SIMIC's trail. Follow this trail and it will lead to the Grouse Mountain chalet.You can also take the Grouse Mountain gondola back down and return to where you parked your car by walking along the Powerline Trail, which takes about 30-40 minutes. To reach the Powerline Trail, walk towards the gravel parking lot near the Grouse Grind and continue walking through the parking lot, down the hill towards a metal gate. Walk past the metal gate and stay under the powerlines and the trail will return to the parking area on Skyline Drive. You can also take the Grouse Mountain gondola back down and return to where you parked your car by walking along the Powerline Trail, which takes about 30-40 minutes. To reach the Powerline Trail, walk towards the gravel parking lot near the Grouse Grind and continue walking through the parking lot, down the hill towards a metal gate.

Skywalk North Loop,5.0,Whistler,Difficult,9.0,19.5,July - September,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/skywalk-north-loop/,"The Skywalk North Loop is a hiking route that follows several trails on the west side of Whistler, taking you up into the alpine for incredible views of Rainbow Glacier, Iceberg Lake, Screaming Cat Lake, and many mountain ranges in the region. While snow can linger into July at the higher elevations, the challenging route takes you well into the backcountry before looping back and passing through the scenic meadows near Rainbow Mountain. The network of trails can be a bit confusing to navigate, particularly near the lower sections. This description will start from Mountain View Drive and follow the Lower 19 Mile Creek Trail to the Screaming Cat Lake Connector Trail. Then follows the Scream Cat Lake Connector, then up the Flank Trail North to Screaming Cat Lake, before following the Skywalk North Trail to Iceberg Lake. The route then returns via the Upper and Lower 19 Mile Creek Trails. This route does not include theSkywalk South Trailas doing both the north and south routes as day-hikes is very difficult and requires more than one day to complete for most. There is also a route that goes directly toIceberg Lakeby the 19 Mile Creek Route and returns the same way, less challenging then completely the Skywalk North sections. From the wooden signboard at the end of Mountain View Drive, walk past it and immediately turn left at the trail marker, following the trail uphill. Walk a short distance up until you reach a gravel road, then go left walking up the gravel road for about 40m to another trail sign on the right side, where the Lower 19 Mile Creek continues. Follow this trail as it continues to climb until you reach a second gravel road. Cross this road and walk up the path on the other side, entering the forest. Follow the trail across a small bridge before the path begins to climb steadily. You gain plenty of elevation in the first section of this route, so make sure to pace yourself. At a sign to a viewpoint, walk a few metres out to see the view of Green Lake below. Return to the trail and a short distance further, cross a 4-way junction with a mountain biking trail. Just after passing the mountain biking trail, the trail reaches a wide section where you go right and hike up the steep hill. At the top of this section, go left and a few metres on the right is a trail marker for the Screaming Cat Lake Connector Trail. It's important to find this trail marker as this is where the loop starts and ends. Follow the Screaming Cat Connector Trail as it climbs up the mountain, continuing to gain elevation. Go straight through, what looks like, a 4-way junction and pass another trail sign. At another sign, go right onto the Flank Trail and continue following the route as the elevation gain becomes more gradual. The route continues to pass through forest, offering few views. When you arrive at another sign for the Upper Howler Trail, make sure to go right and continue uphill as the route to the left is a mountain biking trail. The next section gains elevation very gradually as you quickly make your way through the forest until you reach a junction with the Valley Lookout Trail. Going right is a side hike that is about 260m and climbs up onto a rocky bluff, offering scenic views down the valley towards Showh Lakes. Return to the trail and continue following it until you reach a junction where you must go left towards Screaming Cat Lake. There's still about 800m to the lake, so follow the trail and watch for trail markings and signs. Go left and follow a worn path between two small hills as and veers to the right, following the path until you end up next to Screaming Cat Lake on your right. The scenic lake offers a great place to stop before continuing and the lake also marks the start of the Skywalk North Trail. Follow the trail to the far end of the lake to where it leaves the area and climbs steeply. The continues through forest before descending and arriving at a meadow. Walk along the path, through the meadow to a junction with the Kevin's Homerun Trail. Kevin's Home Run Trail connects the Skywalk North Trail to a section over halfway down the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail. This trail offers a shorter return trip, if needed, however there are some incredible views to come, so go right and continue not he Skywalk North route. The trail passes through several scenic meadow areas, offering views of the mountains in the backcountry. The trail veers left and then begins to climb steeply again, taking you even higher before it passes over an open rock area, offering glimpses of Rainbow Mountain ahead and incredible views of the Soo Mountain Ranges and Ipsoot Mountain. Follow the trail markers as you, sort of, zig zag your way through the alpine. The trail begins to climb steeply again as it passes a lake down to the left, before veering right and climbing up an even steeper section. The route then crosses a rocky section where, looking down to the left, you can see Green Lake and part of Whistler. Eventually, the trail veers left and begins to descend as you have past the high point for this route. Carefully make your way downhill, catching the occasional glimpse of Iceberg Lake and many incredible views of Rainbow Glacier. After descending through a series of switch backs, the trail crosses one more rocky section and arrives just above Iceberg Lake, which is situated at the base of Rainbow Mountain. Walk down to the lake area and find a place to relax to soak in the incredible alpine views. The water is extremely cold and snow often lingers at the lake area well into July as the area gets less sun on the north side of the mountain. After enjoying the views at Iceberg Lake, begin your descent back to the trailhead via the 19 Mile Creek Trail. The trail begins on a worn path, a few metres up the hill by the lake and descends down into the valley towards the meadows in the direction of the drainage river from the lake. Follow the route over the rocks, carefully watch your step and watching for trail markers and worn areas for the trail. Make sure to frequently stop to enjoy the views as all angles are quite spectacular. The trail reaches the meadow, leaving the rocky route behind and following a dirt trail as it crosses over a few small bridges. The views from the meadows of the mountains are incredible, with multiple waterfalls in sight from the melting ice. Follow the trail until it reaches a junction with the Skywalk South Trail. The Skywalk South route is a much longer route back and is not easily done as a day-hike, so save this route for another day. Go left and follow the Upper 19 Mile Creek downhill into the forest. The descent along the Upper 19 Mile Creek is also quite scenic as it follows the creek for quite sometime, where there can be small waterfalls. The trail crosses several small bridges over muddy sections as you enjoy the sounds of the rushing water. Eventually, cross a bridge over 19 Mile Creek and then pass the junction with the start of Kevin's Home Run Trail. Continue down the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail until it ends at a wide trail called the Flank Trail. Go left on the Flank Trail and walk for a couple of minutes before reaching the junction with the Lower 19 Mile Creek Trail. Go right and follow the Lower 19 Mile Creek Trail downhill as you make your downhill quickly, then go right at a second junction. The trail will reach the sign and junction with the Screaming Cat Connector Trail where you began your look earlier in the day. Go right and down the wide, steep trail and then make a left back onto a narrow trail, going straight across the 4-way junction with the mountain biking trail. Continue down the steep trail until it eventually reaches the first logging road. Cross the road and walk down the trail to the second road. Go left on the second logging road and walk about 40m to where the trail continues on the right side, making the final descent back down to the cul-de-sac at Mountain View Drive."
Skywalk South Loop,0.0,Whistler,Difficult,7.0,19.0,July - September,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/skywalk-south-loop/,"The Skywalk South route is located on the west side of Whistler and follows several trails up into the alpine offering incredibly scenic views of Rainbow Mountain, Rainbow Glacier, and views across the Whistler valley. Hikers can decide whether to add an extra 2km (1km each way) up the steep, rocky trail to Iceberg Lake before returning. There are several different trails that the Skywalk South route follows, beginning from the top of Alpine Way and following Rick?s Roost before going left on the Rainbow Flank Trail. Eventually, the route joins with the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail where you can hike further to Iceberg Lake or return back down hill, before going right on the Rainbow-Flank North Trail and arriving back at Alpine Way. It is also best to plan to do theSkywalk North Loopas a separate day-hike. From the top of Alpine Way, walk past the yellow metal gate and follow the wide gravel road as it heads uphill quickly. This route is known as Rick?s Roost. At a clearing, go left and stay on the main gravel road as it passes a second switchback before climbing steeply again. After following the gravel road for about 45-minutes, watch for a post with a white sign on the left marked with the Rainbow Flank Trail. Go left onto the Rainbow Flank Trail and follow the narrow route through the forest as it climbs at a gradual pace. Within 30-minutes, you?ll reach a clearing that is used as a launch point for paragliders, which also offers a great view looking down towards Whistler. Just 5-minutes beyond the paraglider launch area, you will reach a junction with the Skywalk South Trail. Go right and follow the Skywalk South as it climbs very steeply through the forest and passes a large green structure. After hiking for about 20-30 minutes, you will reach another junction with a sign for the Rainbow?s End Trail. It?s a bit confusing because it seems like you are leaving the Skywalk South Trail but you will follow the Rainbow?s End Trail for quite awhile up into the alpine until it rejoins the Skywalk South Trail at another junction. Go right onto the Rainbow?s End Trail and begin hiking uphill for quite awhile. The trail climbs at a fairly steady pace, steep in some sections, before reaching the sub alpine where it briefly descends before climbing again. The higher you get, the fewer the trees and the better the views. Remember to look back as you begin to see incredible views back down towards Whistler and across to Black Tusk. If you time it right in August, the meadows will be filled with a sea of colour wildflowers. The trail eventually reaches a junction in the alpine with the Skywalk South Trail. Go right onto Skywalk South and go up the small hill where you immediately reach a beautiful small lake. Walk along the trail on the left side of the lake over the loose rock as it hugs the shoreline and follow the orange markers as you continue through the alpine. On a clear day, this next section of trail should treat you to some non-stop incredible views of the alpine and surrounding area around Rainbow Mountain. Continue following the trail, watching for markers until you reach a viewpoint, just before the trail descends. This will be the highest elevation point of the hike and a great place to stop for lunch before the trail descends down towards the meadow and meets with the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail. Follow the Skywalk South Trail downhill, carefully watching your step on the loose rock and looking up to see the changing views. Each view gives a different angle of Rainbow Glacier, Rainbow Mountain, and the mountains to the east of Whistler. There is another great viewpoint on a rocky bluff that looks down onto the meadows below Rainbow Glacier, while a few steps behind, you can peer down the valley towards Whistler. The trail continues to descend before passing the outhouse and reaching the junction with the Upper 19 Mile Trail. At the junction, you will have to decide whether to hike an extra 1km (2km each way) up the steep rocky trail to Iceberg Lake. If you decide not to, it is still worth going left at the junction and walking about 100 metres to a view of the meadows with Rainbow Glacier towering above. During mid-July, just after the snow has melted in the meadow, there are several waterfalls on the rocks as the snow melts from the higher elevation. From the junction, begin your return hike going down the Upper 19 Mile Creek Trail as it descends into the forest, following the creek on the left. There are several switchbacks, wooden steps, and a few small waterfalls along the trail. Cross a wooden bridge over the creek and continue past the junction with Kevin?s Home Run Trail. The Upper 19 Mile Creek veers away from the creek as you pass through the forest and some marshy areas. Eventually, the trail regions a junction with a wide trail called the Rainbow-Flank North Trail. Hikers who went straight to Iceberg Lake for the day will be going left, however, you must go right on this trail to return to Alpine Way. Go right and follow the wide, gravel trail as it soon passes over a wooden bridge over the creek. Continue following the wide gravel trail and it will take you all the way back to Alpine Way. The route will eventually pass the junction where you turned onto the Rainbow-Flank Trail earlier in the day, before descending down the steep gravel road and through the two switchbacks, returning to the yellow gate where you began."
Slesse Memorial Trail,3.6,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,6.0,12.0,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/slesse-memorial-trail/,"The Slesse Memorial Trail in Chilliwack is steeped in history as the route passes a memorial plaque remembering the victims of one of Canada's worst aviation disasters. The hiking trail continues up to the base of Mount Slesse, known as the Propeller Cairn, where a piece of one of the propellers from the plane is propped up by rocks next to other artifacts. The view from the Propeller Cairn is incredible as you stand in front of the towering Mount Slesse and can look across the valley to Mount Rexford and the surrounding region. The route up the NE Buttress of Mount Slesse is also a well known mountain climbing destination. From the tall wooden sign marking the trailhead for the Slesse Memorial Trail, follow the trail into the forest as it descends, weaving its way through the forest. A short distance into the hike, the trail follows alongside Nesakwatch Creek before reaching a log bridge. As of 2017, the bridge has recently been rebuilt and railings have been added thanks to the Chilliwack Outdoor Club. Follow the trail as it ascends through the forest, passing through a few switchbacks as you quickly gain elevation. The trail then becomes quite rocky and passes under a canopy of alders as it climbs at a gentle pace. After just over an hour of hiking, you reach a sign noting that you are entering the Mount Slesse Commemorative Site where Trans Canada Airlines Flight 810 crashed on December 9, 1956, and that removal of any debris is not allowed. Despite months of searching, the crash site was not found until May of the following year due to the remoteness and ruggedness of the area. To this day, many pieces of the plane have not been found and still remain in the area. Continue following the trail to where, a short distance further, you reach the memorial plaque that is perched in front of Mount Slesse. The plaque is the destination for many day hikers who want to see this part of the area's history and also the incredible view of Mount Slesse in the background. The trail to the Propeller Cairn continues about 10-metres before the plaque on the left side. Follow the trail as it climbs steadily but not too steeply, through the tree cover. After a long gradual uphill, the trail veers to the right and reaches a clearing, offering some views of the surrounding area. Continue up as you carefully watch your step climbing up some rock before resuming up a steeper section of trail through several switchbacks. As the trail briefly levels, you pass through an old-growth grove with several large cedar trees. Watch for glimpse of views on both sides of the trail. As you leave the forest, the trail opens up and you make a final, steep ascent up the mountain, before reaching the Propeller Cairn. The views from the Propeller Cairn are incredible as you look up towards the towering Mount Slesse, across to the pointy peaks of Mount Rexford, and south into the United States along the Coast Mountain range. The memorial site where the propeller sticks out of the rock has many other pieces from the plane wreckage that have been discovered over the years and seeing the surroundings from this elevation, one can truly appreciate the difficulty of searching for the wreckage during the winter months. After spending some time at the Propeller Cairn to enjoy the view, begin your hike back down, following the trail and carefully watching your step along the loose gravel and muddy sections. Follow the trail back into the forest as it weaves its way downhill before reaching the rocky portion of trail and beginning the long walk back to the first memorial plaque. Enjoy the view from the plaque one last time, then follow the trail back downhill, eventually reaching the forested area, crossing the log bridge, and walking the final uphill stretch back to the parking area."
Slhanay Peak Trail,0.0,Howe Sound,Difficult,5.0,6.5,April - November,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/slhanay-peak-trail/,"The Slhanay Peak Trail is a rugged hike that takes you to several incredible views that overlook the town of Squamish and the nearby Stawamus Chief. The trail is steep and has several technical sections and is therefore rated as difficult. The trailhead is located along the Mamquam River Forest Service Road where it immediately enters the forest and climbs up a rocky trail. The first 50 metres is a gradual incline but once the trail gets onto the mountain side, the path begins to climb very steeply. Zig zag your way up the hill, being careful where you step, until you get close to the rock wall. Follow the trail to the right of the walk wall as it continues climbing and you carefully make your way over several boulders. The next section of trail is the trickiest as it passes along a narrow path where there is a steep downhill to your right. Be very careful not to venture too close to the edge. The trail wraps around a cliff area and then arrives at a viewpoint. This viewpoint is partially blocked by trees and there is a much better viewpoint a short distance further along the trail. Continue along the trail and watch for a small trail on the right that takes you to a rocky outcrop with a view of Squamish and the Stawamus Chief to the left. Return to the trail and, a short distance beyond the views, go left at a junction. The hike is much easier and passes through a lush forest with plenty of moss, only ascending at a gradual pace. At a second junction, go left again and continue to follow the well defined trail. During the next section of trail, it's important to watch for a trail heading off to the right as this takes you to the best view along the Slhanay Peak Trail, known as Tony's Lookout. The trail is not obviously marked as there is a worn wooden sign on a tree but it can easily be missed. Once you reach the path on the right, follow the short 150 metre trail and walk up onto the rocky outcropped towards a bench overlooking one of the most magnificent views in the area. For many, this might be the end point of their hike as Tony's Lookout offers a much clearer view than at the summit. Walk back down the rocky outcrop and return to the main trail. If you are heading to the summit, continue walking uphill and a short distance later, you reach a junction next to a damaged wooden sign post. The trail to the left goes up a steep hill to the summit and is a more direct route. The trail to the right is much longer and wraps around before reaching the summit, however there are no views along the longer route. Go left at the junction and follow the more direct trail to the peak. The trail climbs gradually at first but then becomes very steep as you continue to make your way up the hill. Eventually, the trail begins to level where there is a small trail to the right to a false peak. Continue along the main trail as it passes through a small forested grove and approaches a large rock wall. At the junction by the rock wall, go left and make your way up onto the rock, following the worn route where you reach the peak of Slhanay a short distance further. After enjoying the peak, walk back down the rocky summit, and return into the forest along the trail. Make sure to go right at the junction after entering the forest, otherwise you will be on a different route and will end up doing the long trail. Follow the trail down the steep hill until it returns to the main trail. Go right and head back down hill, passes through the forested area and past all of the viewpoints. When you reach the viewpoint near the section of trail with the steep cliff, be very careful hiking around this and back over the boulders as you make your way downhill. The downhill descent is very steep and the terrain uneven, so be careful where you step and make sure to take your time. Eventually, you get to the bottom and quickly make your way out of the forest and back onto the FSR."
Smoke Bluffs Park,4.5,Howe Sound,Easy,1.5,3.5,February - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/smoke-bluffs-park/,"Smoke Bluffs Park in Squamish is a popular area for rock climbers that has a well maintained hiking trail that loops around the park. The Loop Trail passes through the park and is primarily used by climbers to access the many different climbing areas. However, it's a nice scenic hike that also stops at a few viewpoints looking out towards Howe Sound. The trail begins from the wooden map board next to the parking lot. Follow the trail to the left, which is for hikers only, as it climbs steeply. Stay on the main trail as the narrow trails to the side are used by the climbers for accessing the climbing area called Crag X. Pass through the wooden posts and go left on the wide trail, continuing up the gravel hill as you pass the Smoke Bluff Wall on your left and continue towards the Neat and Cool climbing area. It can be quite a spectacle to stop and watch the climbers briefly before resuming your hike. The trail begins to level out and reaches a children's playground with picnic tables. Just beyond the playground on the left is a junction which marks the start of the Loop Trail. This description will describe the route in a clockwise direction and you will return to this spot again before walking back down to the parking lot. Going left at the sign for the Loop Trail, walk up the steep, narrow gravel trail as it climbs quickly. Within minutes, you reach a junction with a sign pointing to the Upper Loop. Go right and continue uphill to another junction. Again, go right and through a couple of switchbacks to a 3rd junction which is the start of the upper loop. Go right and within a few seconds, you will see a wooden bench on a rock to the right marking the first viewpoint. The first viewpoint looks out to Howe Sound and down to the industrial areas of Squamish. Continue along the trail a short distance to where the route arrives onto a large rock at the second viewpoint. The second viewpoint also looks out towards Howe Sound and offers a glimpse of the nearby Chief towering high above. A bit further and you arrive at the third viewpoint, which is smaller but looks south, down along the Sea To Sky Highway. After enjoying the three viewpoints, continue following the trail as it loops around, passing a couple more climbing areas before arriving back at the junction where the loop began. Go straight, back down the hill but at the second junction, this time go straight and rejoin the Loop Trail a short distance further. Follow the Loop Trail as is continues to ascend through the scenic forest, passing through a series of switchbacks. Eventually, the trail reaches a junction where you have to decide to go the long route (left) or the shorter route (right). We'll go left, following the longer route as it continues gradually ascending through the beautiful forest before wrapping around and descending between large rock faces, meeting with the shorter route at the junction near Funarama. Continue along the trail as it heads towards the climbing area called Call It A Day. The trail just after this section can be a bit tricky to follow but stay on the wider trail until you reach another sign at a 3-way junction before Ronin's Corner. Go left and down the stairs to a wide gravel trail that's not far from Tunnel Rock. Then, go right on the wide gravel pathway and follow it as it goes behind several houses, past a street to your left, and arrives back at the children's playground where you began the loop. Follow the main path back down the hill towards the parking lot, noticing all the climbers scaling the rock faces as you walk. At the wooden gates with the “no bikes	” sign, go right and walk down on this trail until you reach the parking lot area."
Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park,5.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,1.5,4.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/smuggler-cove/,"Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park is located north of Sechelt and is a beautiful area that offers scenic coastal views of the cove and shoreline along the Strait of Georgia. The hike is fairly easy with a few sections that ascend as you make your way up onto the rocks for views of the park. The area has some notable history as the cove was used to transport Chinese workers into the United States in the late-1800?s. Then, during the period of prohibition, smugglers would hide from authorities in the cove as they transported alcohol south into the United States. Begin your hike to Smuggler Cove from the parking area by following the trail into the forest as it gradually descends, enjoying the peacefulness of the surroundings. Within minutes, the trail reaches a wooden platform that veers left and passes through a bog. Follow the gravel trail as it passes over another bridge and then reaches a third raised walkway next to another bog. The third wooden walkway is the longest as it provides views of the scenic bog where several beavers live and work. Continue hiking along the trail, through the forest, until you reach a sign at a junction. Going left takes you on a trail that takes about 10-15 minutes to the end where you arrive at a rocky beach next to Grant Island. Enjoy the views before following the trail back to the junction and taking the other route. From the junction, follow the main trail to the right as it climbs uphill and offers glimpses of Smuggler Cove to the right. As you continue to follow the trail, stay to the left if you notice a junction as the route will loop back to this point. Watch for an opening in the trees on the left and follow the trail out onto a rocky outcrop with an incredible view of the Strait of Georgia. Return to the trail and continue following it as it climbs up to a high point on a rocky above the entrance to Smugglers Cove. On a sunny day, the water in the cove can be a translucent green. The trail continues along the high point, offering more views of the cove as it begins to loop back. When the trail descends down a hill, it rejoins the trail where you began the loop. Continue to follow the trail back in the direction towards the parking lot as you pass the junction, stay to the left, then cross the raised wooden platforms next to the bogs. Within minutes, return to the parking lot where you began."
Soames Hill,4.3,Sunshine Coast,Intermediate,1.0,2.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/soames-hill/,"Soames Hill is a steep hike that is located in Gibsons near Shirley Macey Park and has incredible views that look across towards Keats Island and out towards the Strait of Georgia. The hike follows a steep set of stairs, offering a good workout that is rewarded with several beautiful views. There are two locations that the you can start the trail from, either from Bridgeman Road or Esperanza Road. Both routes will go to the bottom of the Green trail, then follow the Green trail to the top of the hill. This trail description begins from Bridgeman Road but both routes are similar distances and the trails are well marked with maps. From Bridgeman Road, walk past the yellow gate and follow the Yellow trail into the forest. The beautiful west coast rainforest is lush with vegetation, including moss and sword ferns that blanket the area. Watch for a sign with a trail junction on your left marking the start of the Green trail. Go left and follow the Green trail as you begin to climb the steep stairs on the hillside. The trail weaves back and forth as you continue to gain elevation while occasionally stopping to catch your breath and let people by who are descending. As the trail begins to level, you reach a junction. Go right and follow the trail for a short walk that takes you up onto a rock with a viewpoint. The view offers glimpses across the water towards Keats Island, however the better viewpoints are at a high point further up the trail. Follow the trail back down to the junction and this time go left and continue hiking up the trail. The trail will reach another junction, go left and follow the one that continues up a steep hill. Within a few minutes, a viewpoint appears on your right. Continue hiking up the hill, watching your step over the smooth rock and checking the views off to the right. Eventually, the trail reaches a final viewpoint that looks out towards Keats Island. The town of Gibson can also be seen from the viewpoint as you peer down the coastline and out towards the Strait of Georgia. After enjoying the view, follow the trail back downhill the way you came, being careful as you step on the slippery rock. At the first junction, go right and follow the trail up a small incline before it descends again through the forest. Pass the sign at the second junction and begin to descend down the steep stairs. The descent is quick as you reach the bottom, returning to the Yellow trail. Go right and follow the Yellow trail back to the Bridgeman Road parking area."
Spirit Caves Trail,4.5,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,3.5,4.5,April - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/spirit-caves-trail/,"Located in the town of Yale, BC, the Spirit Caves Trail is a steep hike that leads to an incredible viewpoint looking down at the Fraser River. Beyond the viewpoint are some small caves amongst large rocks, however it's the main attraction for many on this trail. The hike begins from the side of the Trans Canada Highway, by a wooden sign marking the trailhead. Follow the trail into the forest as it immediately climbs and then makes its way onto a wooden stairway. A short distance further and the trail crosses a creek before ascending steeply and rounding another section to a second creek crossing. A few minutes further and there is a viewpoint on the right but having only gained a bit of elevation so far, the better view will be further up the trail. Continue hiking as the trail begins to ascend quickly through a series of switchbacks. During the summer months, be careful as the dry dirt can be quite slippery and cause you to slide on the loose dirt. Continue to hike uphill as the trail offers some glimpses to the right of the Fraser River. The route eventually begins to flatten as you make your way alongside the mountain on a very narrow section of trail. It's not easy to pass other hikers along this section of trail, so you will have to stop and find a way to sidestep each other, being mindful of the steep slope downward to your right. When the trail turns to the left, this is the first switchback in a series of them where the hike climbs steeply again. Continue making your way through the switchbacks as you quickly gain elevation. Eventually, the trail reaches the viewpoint next to two wooden benches. The spectacular as view looks down towards the Fraser River as it moves through a bend downstream and away from the town of Yale. For most hikers, the viewpoint is a good place to end their hike as the small caves are not too spectacular. For those wanting to see the caves, they are about another 10-minutes uphill, following the well worn path from the viewpoint. Watch for a large set of rocks on your left where the first cave can be seen from the distance. The second cave is close to the main trail but also is easy to miss if you are not looking for it by the rocks. A small trail goes off to the left and it's worth following it up onto the rocks to look for other caves and to see a viewpoint of the nearby mountains. After seeing the caves and the viewpoint, begin your trek back downhill as you quickly descend. Be careful of your steps and that you don't slide as you make your way through the steep switchbacks. The sound of the creek can be heard as you get closer to the bottom. After walking back down the wooden stairs and hiking a bit further, you arrive back at the trailhead next to the highway."
St Mark's Summit,4.2,The North Shore,Intermediate,5.0,11.0,July - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/st-marks-summit/,"St. Mark's Summit is part of the Howe Sound Crest Trail that spans over 30km from Cypress to a point along the Sea to Sky Highway near Porteau Cove. The section of the trail that St. Mark's Summit is on starts from Cypress Mountain which is the first mountain along this route and offers spectacular views of Howe Sound on a clear day. From the Cypress Mountain downhill parking lot, head north towards the nearby chairlift and look for the Howe Sound Crest Trail sign. The trail follows alongside the several ski runs until a sign that points to the right to the Howe Sound Crest Trail. Follow this trail uphill until it merges onto a wider ski run and veer to the left towards a large green water tower. Just before the tower, go right onto a trail and walk uphill through the trees. After a short hike, the trail reaches a gravel road. Go left at the gravel road and continue as a short distance later the road narrows and becomes a trail. You are now on the Howe Sound Crest Trail and this route will take you to St. Mark's Summit. About 10 minutes after entering the forest, you reach a junction with a map of the area. Just beyond the mapboard is a clearing with a view of the Lions off in the distance. Continue along the trail as it winds along the mountainside and gradually heads uphill. The trail emerges briefly into a small meadow and crosses two bridges before continuing uphill. A few minutes later, the climb begins to steepen as the trail goes through a series of switchbacks. The path then begins to level and a brief downhill section along the top of the ridge offers some relief from the steep hill on a warm day. The relief is short lived as the trail climbs again through another series of switchbacks that are steeper than the previous ones. As the trail levels out, you have reached the upper region of St. Mark's Summit. Continue another short distance over the rocky terrain until you reach a point where you can see Unnecessary Mountain and the Lions off in the distance. Do not descend but instead, go left to a scenic viewpoint of the area. On a clear day, you can see views of Howe Sound, the Tantalus Range, and even the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island off in the distance. There are a few other viewpoints along the short ridge that are worth checking out before making your journey back towards Cypress Mountain. After resting and soaking in the gorgeous views over lunch, make your way back to the trail and retrace your steps heading back downhill through the switchbacks towards Mt. Strachan Meadows and eventually the parking lot at Cypress Mountain."
Stanley Park,4.5,Vancouver City,Easy,2.0,6.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/stanley-park/,"The world-famous Stanley Park is one of the major attractions for tourists when they visit Vancouver. Located next to the downtown core, Stanley Park is full of trails for walking and biking and has numerous scenic views from English Bay to the inner harbour. Despite being located in a major city, you can take one of the many networks of trails and still feel as though you're away from all the hustle and bustle of the city life. There are many routes through the park and the best opportunity for planning your trip is to look at a map to determine your route. However, for this description, we will start near the Rose Garden and bus loop, a central area of the park. From the gardens, walk across the Pipeline Road and along the South Creek Trail. The thick green forest is lined with Cedar, Hemlock, and Douglas Fir trees. At the junction go right and then a short distance later right again and head around Beaver Lake as it rounds the lake in a counterclockwise direction. Stop to look at the different species of ducks living in the lake. Occasionally, a long-legged heron can be seen walking through the shallow lake looking for fish. Continue around the lake and veer off onto the Lake Trail as it becomes paved. The sound of cars can be heard ahead as you reach an overpass that crosses over the Stanley Park Causeway that connects the downtown core with the North Shore via the Lions Gate Bridge. After crossing over the causeway, go right and along the Bridle Path as the sound of traffic weakens. Pass the first junction but go left on the second junction and onto the Rawlings Trail. The park is home to many squirrels and birds that are often visible as you walk through the forest. Continue along the Rawlings Trail to the Hollow Tree, a huge Red Cedar tree with a large enough opening to fit a car into. After taking photos of the popular tourist attraction, continue along the trail until meeting with the junction at Tatlow Walk. Go right onto Tatlow Walk and carefully cross the road towards Third Beach. Third Beach is a popular summer beach where city residents come to enjoy the sunshine and view of English Bay. After enjoying a break, head back towards the Tatlow Walk where you came from and back into the forest. Continue along the Tatlow Walk Trail for the next 1.2km towards Lost Lagoon, enjoying the fresh scents of Cedar and Fir trees. Cross the paved road and walk a few more steps down to the lagoon. Follow the trail to the left as it wraps around the east end of Lost Lagoon towards the city. The lagoon is a popular area for city residents to jog and walk and it is also home to several beautiful swans. Once on the other side of the lagoon, take the tunnel to cross underneath the busy Georgia Street. Just on the other side is a view of Coal Harbour. If you walked to the park or are planning on walking back into downtown, go right at this point for the short walk to Georgia and Denman Streets. If you are heading back to your car or the bus loop, continue to your left along the paved walkway back towards the park. At the roundabout, cross the street and head towards the gardens where you started your journey earlier in the day."
Stave Dam Forest Interpretation Forest,0.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,1.6,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/stave-dam-forest-interpretation-forest/,"The Stave Dam Forest Interpretation Trail is a loop through a forest managed by the District of Mission. The route climbs uphill to a couple of viewpoints that overlook the Stave Lake area and the route offers a look at the beautiful forest in the region. Before you go on this hike, it's worth printing out thebrochureprovided by the District of Mission. The route has several numbered signs, which correspond to the descriptions in the brochure. The trail begins on the east side of Dewdney Trunk Road at a small wooden plank next to a gravel parking area by the road. Walk up the wooden plank and into the forest as the route climbs towards a junction. Make sure to go left at the junction to hike the loop in a clockwise direction as this corresponds with the numbered signs in the brochure. Follow the trail to the left as it continues uphill passing through the beautiful forest. The route climbs steeply until it reaches a gravel road. Cross the gravel road where the trail continues on the other side, following the wider trail uphill. As the trail begins to level, make sure you are continuing to follow the markers on the trees. The trail makes its way up through a narrow section onto some rocks as this section is easy to miss if you are not following the markers. Once on the rocky ridge, you are treated to a spectacular view that overlooks the Stave Lake area, offering clear sight lines off into the distance on a sunny day. After enjoying the view, the trail continues on the other side of the rocky ridge, entering back into the forest and looping around. Within minutes, you are treated to another viewpoint that is similar to the first. Continuing along the trail, it begins to descend as you carefully make your way back downhill enjoying the fresh air of the forest. After hiking downhill for sometime, you reach the gravel road. Cross the road and continue on the trail through the forest as you immediately cross a small bridge. Within a few more minutes, you reach the junction where you began. Go left and back down the last section, crossing over the plank and returning to the gravel parking area next to the road."
Stawamus Chief,4.4,Howe Sound,Intermediate,6.0,11.0,March - November,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/stawamus-chief/,"The Stawamus Chief is one of the region's classic hikes that takes you up the steep trail to one of its three peaks, offering incredible views of the area surrounding Squamish, including Howe Sound and north to Garibaldi Provincial Park. The hike to the top is challenging in sections and there are a few places where features help assist you, including a ladder and chains, but the reward is well worth the effort. The Chief has 3 peaks and it's possible to hike all three in the same day. If you were to hike them in order, you would have to walk part way down the trail from the first peak, then go up to the second peak from a junction. From the second peak, you can continue over the peak and it drops down into a canyon where the trail climbs to the third peak. A rough estimation of time would be 6-hours to complete on you level of fitness. Alternative, you could just go to the 1st or 2nd peaks which take roughly 2.5 hours to the top and back. From the trailhead off the Sea To Sky Highway, walk into the forest and along the wide trail as you pass by the campsite. Don't let this trail fool you as a short distance further, you reach the wooden stairs where the challenging uphill section begins. A bit further up and you reach another junction which goes directly to the 3rd peak. This route is not traveled as often as the other route, so.continue to the left as you make your way up the trail. When the trail reaches another marked junction, this is where the trail goes left to the First Peak and right to the Second and Third Peak. Go left towards the First Peak and continue following the trail. Not too much further up and you reach a metal ladder that you must climb to continue towards the top. After the ladder, the trail continues in the forest until it reaches a rock section with a chain. Use the chain to help pull yourself up the steep surface and then continue hiking up the granite mountain towards the top. There are occasional markers in the rock and some of the rock is well worn from the many hikers, so it should be fairly easy to follow the route. As you approach the top, occasionally look back at the incredible view. The top of the first peak is fairly wide open and has a great view of Howe Sound looking down towards the town of Squamish. After enjoying the view, begin your descent back down, being careful of your footing and making sure to follow the route that you took to the top. The section with the chain is often fairly busy, so you may have to wait for others as you maneuver your way back down the rock section and into the trees. Follow the trail around and then descend down the ladder, back to the junction. If you plan to go to the Second and/or Third Peak, follow the other trail uphill at the junction in the direction of the Second Peak. This trail continues to climb steeply. There are a couple of sections along this route that have chains to help you up the mountain and you will have to be patient on a busy day as you take turns with other hikers. Make the final ascent to the top of the Second Peak for another incredible view of the area. The second peak is slightly higher than the first and offers a different view. To get to the Third Peak, continue up and over the second peak as you follow the trail markers as the trail descends quickly into a valley known as the Saddle. this sits between peaks two and three. Hike the trail up to the third peak for a completely different view that provides a better look at Sky Pilot Mountain and several other mountains towards the North and East. After enjoying the view at the final peak, begin hiking back the route that you came, making your way back down the saddle. At the junction in the saddle, you have the choice of going left and skipping the Second Peak, making your way back down to the main trail via an alternate route, or you can return the way that you came by going back up to the Second Peak. Both routes return via the main trail, with the alternate route joining the main trail well below the junction for the 1st and 2nd trail. Continue hiking back down the steep wooden steps, enjoying the sounds of the rushing water in Olesen Creek before reaching the bottom. Walk back along the wide trail, past the campsite back to the trailhead where you began."
Steelhead Falls,4.5,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.0,3.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/steelhead-falls/,"Steehead Falls is a beautiful waterfall located just off the Reservoir Trail that loops around Hayward Lake in Mission. The hike to the waterfall is a short 1km each way route that is perfect for families or just a quick walk in the forest. From the parking lot area just down from Dewdney Trunk Road, follow the trail downhill and continue past the map board of the Hayward Lake area. At the first junction go right and within less than 1-minute, go left at the second junction following the Reservoir Trail south. The trail passes through a scenic forest and crosses a couple of bridges where the water has a steady flow, depending on the time of year. After crossing the second bridge, the trail veers to the right and wraps around to the left, continuing downhill. Watch for a sign on the right side of the trail at a junction marking the route to Steelhead Falls. Leave the Reservoir Trail and walk down the trail towards Steelhead Falls, watching your step as you make your way down the wooden steps. Within a few minutes, you reach a wooden platform with a spectacular view of the waterfall. After enjoying the falls, follow the trail back up the stairs, returning to the Reservoir Trail. Go left and walk back the way you came, crossing the creeks, until you reach the junction. Go right at the junction and left at the second junction, walking back up to the map board and parking lot where you began."
Suicide Bluffs,0.0,The North Shore,Intermediate,3.0,5.0,July - October,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/suicide-bluffs/,"Suicide Bluffs is located in Mount Seymour Provincial Park in North Vancouver and has several scenic views that look towards the city of Vancouver. The trail has some steep ups and downs and  is technical in places with some rope assists making it more difficult compared to other nearby hiking trails. Starting from the Mount Seymour parking lot, walk to the far end of the parking lot where the big wooden map board is and go right, walking down the short hill towards the ski lift. Walk towards the treeline on the left and follow the rocky Mount Seymour Trail that goes uphill and is parallel to the ski run (do not take the trail to Dog Mountain). Continue walking up the rocky hill, watching your step and pass the junction to Dinkey Peak. Continue past a second junction a short distance further and stay on the main trail, heading uphill. When you reach the 3rd junction where there is a clearing to the left, walk towards that clearing and looking for orange markers on the trees. If you ended up on a wide ski run, you missed the junction and you just have to walk back down the hill to the last junction. Follow the trail and watch for the orange markers. The trail follows a ridgeline and has several ups and downs but make sure to stay on the trail as some of the sections just off the trail are extremely steep and dangerous. The trail eventually reaches a rocky section, where you climb up and onto the rocky bluff and a large open clearing. From here, you can make your way to the far side where you can see great views of the city of Vancouver and the mountains to the northwest. This is Suicide Bluffs. This is a great spot to end your hike, however if you want another view, you can continue to a rocky bluff further along the trail, however the next section of the trail is difficult and very technical. To continue, walk down the trail on the far west side of the rocky bluff, following the oranger markers on trees into the forest. The trail quickly descends and, at one point, requires a rope assist down a very tricky section of trail. After the rope, pass through the switch backs until you reach a small pond at the bottom. Then, the trail begins to ascend and you make your way up onto a rocky outcrop for a great view of the city. The Suicide Bluffs continues beyond this point to a junction along the Dog Mountain Trail but it is not traveled a lot. This trail description suggests you return the same way you arrived by walking back downhill and up the steep hill with the rope assist to the bluff. Then, follow the trail eastward along the narrow route until it rejoins the Mount Seymour Trail, Follow the Mount Seymour Trail back down to the parking lot area."
Sumas Mountain,3.7,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,6.5,13.5,May - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/sumas-mountain/,"Sumas Mountain is one of the most familiar mountains in the Fraser Valley. Located along the north side of the Trans Canada Highway between Abbotsford and Chilliwack, the Sumas Mountain Trail is also part of the Centennial Trail. From the trailhead, make your way into the forest. The trail can be quite muddy in places, particularly in the spring or after a rainfall. The trail weaves its way through the forest until after 10 minutes where you make your way down into a ravine. The trail crosses a well-worn bridge. Enjoy the cool, fresh air the river brings as the majority of the trail will be uphill from this point forward. Make your way up out of the ravine and ascend through the forest. Parts of the trail are very narrow from the overgrowth of plants and trees. The land comprising of Sumas Mountain is disputed as to what jurisdiction it belongs to as well as having a claim by the First Nations to land ownership. It's due to this dispute that the trail is not as actively maintained as many others. After hiking for about an hour, you will reach a gravel road where a section of trees has been clear-cut on the left. This is an unfortunate view along the trail. Walk about 40 meters to the right along the road to where a sign points to the continuation of the trail on the left. Enter the forest again and continue ascending as you take in the fresh scents of the forest. After 20 minutes, the trail levels slightly and continues alongside the mountain. Make sure to always check that you are following the orange markers as it is easy to become disoriented in the trees and lose the trail. Keep an eye open to your left as you may catch the occasional glimpse of the Fraser River below. The trail continues gradually going uphill and crosses another creek. After hiking for 45 minutes or so, you arrive at the calm shores of Chadsey Lake. This beautiful lake is nestled in between thick Douglas Fir trees with Sumas Mountain towering in the background. Walk around to the opposite side of the lake where a trail begins that climbs to the peak of Sumas Mountain. This trail can be steep, narrow, slippery, and sometimes poorly marked so use caution when climbing to the top. About 30 minutes up, a clearing offers a scenic view of the Fraser River and surrounding farms. Continue up the trail for another 30 minutes before reaching the peak. On a clear day you can see views of Mount Baker, Chiliwack, and the surrounding Fraser Valley region. After taking in the views, begin your descent back downhill towards Chadsey Lake. Make sure to take the same trail that you used to arrive at the lake (western approach) then make your way back to the dirt road and eventually back to where you parked earlier in the day."
Swan Falls Viewpoint,4.2,Tri Cities,Intermediate,3.5,10.0,year-round,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/swan-falls-viewpoint/,"Updated March 2025- The trail to Swan Falls is currently closed due to a large rockslide that occured in the area in March 2021. The hike to the Swan Falls viewpoint follows the Buntzen Lake trail to the North Beach, then climbs steeply along the Halvor Lunden to the top of the waterfall. The view from the rocky bluff is a partial view of the northern section of Buntzen Lake as well as the mountains along the western shore of the lake. The ""Intermediate"" rating is given to this trail due to the ruggedness and difficulty of the section of the Halvor Lunden. The 4km section of trail along Buntzen Lake to the North Beach is fairly easy, however the Halvor Lunden Trail is steep and very challenging in sections. It's noted that the viewpoint is only about 15% of the distance along the Halvor Lunden Trail to the junction at the top of the mountain. From the Buntzen Lake parking lot, walk towards the dog off-leash area and follow the trail on the east side of the fence as far towards the lake as possible where there is a wooden map board and a bridge. Cross the bridge and follow the trail as you quickly disappear into the forest and leave the noise of the barking dogs behind you. During the spring, you will pass many small creeks along the first part of the route, however most are dry during the summer months. The trail passes over another wooden bridge before reaching a sign that says ""viewpoint"". Go right at the sign and continue up the short hill as you pass through the beautiful, lush forest. The trail is easy to follow and continues its route northward, passing over many more wooden bridges and offering occasional glimpses of Buntzen Lake. Eventually, the trail climbs up a short hill and reaches the gravel road. A few meters further, rejoin the trail and follow it downhill along the steep switch backs to the bottom where you have a view of the water flowing into the lake from the tunnel that joins with Coquitlam Lake on the other side of Eagle Mountain. Follow the path as it emerges at the North Beach area. Continue walking past the North Beach towards the gravel road, then follow the road northward (do not cross the suspension bridge to the left). A short distance further, the gravel road crosses a small bridge and looking up and to the right, you'll see the water of Swan Falls cascading down from the rocks high above. Continue walking along the gravel road and round a corner to the right about 200-meters further to where a sign marks the start of the Halvor Lunden trail. Follow this trail as you begin your climb. The beginning of the Halvor Lunden climbs gradually but after passing underneath the power lines, the trail begins to climb steeply. Although the route is rugged, occasionally having fallen trees, it is well marked with trail markers on the trees. The viewpoint is located at an elevation of about 325 meters (the start of the Halvor Lunden is about 135 meters elevation) and is easiest found when you reach a rope along the trail meant to help pull yourself up over the steep rock. Pull yourself up the rope and just before you reach the top of the rope, look to your right where a spur trail branches off to a rocky bluff. Carefully step up to the spur trail and away from the rope and walk out onto the rock next to the water flowing over the falls. Be very careful along the rocky bluff at the Swan Falls Viewpoint as you are standing near the top of the Swan Falls waterfall and venturing too close to the water or edge will almost certainly lead towards death. The rocky bluff offers a nice viewpoint to stop and enjoy a snack or lunch before making your way back down the Halvor Lunden Trail. As you descend the trail where you came up, be careful to watch your footing and use your hands where necessary to ensure you do not slip and fall down the steep mountain side. After returning to the gravel road at the start of the Halvor Lunden Trail, go left and return to the North Beach area. You can bypass the steep switch backs by the water tunnel from the Coquitlam Lake by just following the gravel road uphill, then taking the second trail on the right (the same one you came from earlier) that leads to the parking lot area at the south end of Buntzen Lake. Follow the trail back along the lake, enjoying the scenery as you make your way back to the busy beach and dog off-leash area before returning to the parking lot."
Teapot Hill,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,2.0,5.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/teapot-hill/,"The Teapot Hill Trail is located next to Cultus Lake and offers a short hike uphill with a view of the lake. Park in the Teapot Hill parking lot and start the hike heading uphill. After 100m, there is an outhouse and park map on your left. Continue heading up the service road, passing by a stream and groves of mixed deciduous and coniferous trees. After about 20-30 minutes, a sign will be posted that points to Teapot Hill off to the right. Continue along this path passing a sign that describes the area flowers that include Stinging Nettle, Western Columbine, Tiger Lily, and Trillium. A steep hill is an indicator that you are almost there. After ascending the hill, the trail levels out and you come to the first view of Cultus Lake. Stop to take it in briefly before continuing along the trail for another 100m to the second viewpoint that overlooks the lake and Columbia Valley towards the USA. Stop to have a break here or make your way back to the previous viewpoint before descending back down the hill towards the parking lot."
The Lions Binkert Trail,4.5,Howe Sound,Difficult,8.0,16.0,July - October,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/the-lions-binkert-trail/,"The Lions are the two most familiar peaks seen from the city of Vancouver. The view from the Lions is truly spectacular, offering a panoramic view of Howe Sound and the Capilano Watershed down to the city of Vancouver. Starting from the yellow gate in Lions Bay, follow the wide gravel road and after 5 minutes of flat terrain, begin your ascent. A short distance up the trail, you reach a fork that heads off to Mount Harvey. Go right and continue along the wide gravel road as it travels through a series of switchbacks, gradually snaking its way uphill. After 25-30 minutes of hiking, the trail reaches another junction. Again, go right and continue uphill as the trail begins to level. For the next 30 minutes, the trail remains relatively flat but don't get too comfortable with this terrain as the steepest sections are yet to come. The trail wraps around the mountainside and passes a couple of scenic waterfalls. As the dirt trail becomes more and more rocky, watch for a junction on your right with a sign pointing to the Lions. Take this trail and walk down the narrow dirt trail towards Harvey Creek. After crossing the bridge at Harvey Creek, walk up the other side and after about 100 meters, the trail veers to the left to start the next uphill section. Just a short distance after the trail begins to climb, there is a clearing which offers a viewpoint of Howe Sound and Bowen Island. Take a break and enjoy the view because the uphill section is difficult. For the next hour or so, the trail climbs steadily through Douglas Fir and Western Red Cedar forests, passing occasional rockslides that have occurred over thousands of years. Eventually, the trail emerges on a ridge from an opening in the trees and standing tall to your right is the breathtaking site of the West Lions. A more spectacular view awaits on a higher ridge above. Follow the trail to the right and walk towards the West Lions. Keep an eye out for the coloured markers to follow as the terrain gradually turns from trail into large boulders. As you continue your climb, take the occasional moment to stop and look back at the view of Howe Sound and the town of Lions Bay where you started your trek earlier in the day. The route over the boulders continues to climb and with each step seems to get steeper. The last section of the trail is the steepest, climbing up a short gully as you make a scramble to the top. Reaching a ridge, another small hill appears in front of you. Just a few more minutes up this section and you have reached another ridge that offers a full view of both Lions' peaks as well as the views of Howe Sound, Unnecessary Mountain, and Vancouver off to the left. After having lunch, taking photos, and reflecting on your trek so far, it's time to head back down the mountain towards Lions Bay. Retrace your steps back down the rocky slope to the ridge just below, making sure to watch for the orange markings that lead back the way you came. Going straight in the wrong direction will take you to Unnecessary Mountain, making for a longer day. Walk back down over the rocks, being careful not to slip on loose gravel or unsecured rocks. After returning to the clearing to the west of the West Lions, enter the forest and begin your descent as you enjoy the fresh air of the surrounding trees. Eventually, the sound of Harvey Creek can be heard as you veer to the right and end up on the bridge crossing above. Continue up the short slope to the wide road and follow the road as it weaves back around the mountainside and eventually widens before making a final descent through a series of switchbacks and ending at the yellow gate where you began your trek."
Three Brothers Mountain,4.3,Manning Provincial Park,Intermediate,7.0,21.5,July - September,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/three-brothers-mountain/,"Three Brothers Mountain is one of the most scenic hikes in Manning Provincial Park. Located on the north side of Highway #3, the trail begins from a parking lot at over 2000-meters in elevation before making its way along the Heather Trail, through scenic meadows and across ridges with incredible views towards the Brothers. Although the elevation gain is listed at 480 meters, there are several downhill and uphill sections along the trail, so the cumulative elevation gain is over 900 meters. Also, the first 4km of the trail are downhill, which means that when you return to the parking lot at the end of the hike, you will have to hike uphill for the last 4km. From gravel parking area, follow the trail that heads north as it makes its way up and over a few rocks with views before descending quickly. The trail is easy to follow and continues descending until it reaches a set of wooden stairs, where it quickly drops down to a junction with a trail to the lower parking lot. Go right and continue your hike towards the Three Brothers. The trail makes its way through an alpine forest, offering little in the way of views, however the easy terrain and gradual downhill mean you can move quickly through this section. There is a small, red marker on a tree at the 4km mark and just a short distance further, you arrive at the Buckhorn Campsite. Cross the small bridge and continue following the Heather Trail, leaving the campsite as the trail begins to ascend uphill. The route continues in a northward direction as you continue gaining elevation, occasionally passing small open areas but still not offering much in the way of views. Eventually, the trail emerges from the trees to an open grass meadow where the view gets better with each step you take. At this point, you are able to see views across the meadows to ridges in the far distance. At a junction with the Bonnevier Trail, continue straight along the Heather Trail. The trail continues making its way through the meadow, offering unprecedented views. Follow the gravel path up onto a ridge where there is an incredible view to the east and you can see Three Brothers Mountain up ahead. The trail briefly descends a short, steep section before wrapping around and arriving at a junction to the First Brother. Leave the Heather Trail by going right and following the trail up the steep hill as you make your way up towards the peak of the First Brother. As you approach the ridge and are able to see over it, you get a wonderful view of the entire region. Follow the narrow trail along the ridge, being careful to watch your step and not venture too close to the edge. The trail reaches another steep section where, this time, you have to scramble up a short section as you make your way to the peak. From the peak, you are standing on the First Brother and have a full 360-degree view of the entire region. It's interesting to see the different climates as you see drier terrain to the north and several snow-capped mountain peaks to the south, many of which are in the United States and part of the Cascade Range. You can continue walking past the peak to a second point that is slightly lower but also offers an alternate spectacular view of the area. After enjoying the views, begin descending back downhill as you carefully watch your step back down the steep section and along the ridge. Hike back down the hill to the junction with the Heather Trail and go left, heading back towards Buckhorn Camp and the parking lot. Begin the long hike back, enjoying the scenery and the views of the mountain ranges from a different angle. As you leave the meadows and continue descending towards the campsite, keep in mind that the final 4km after the campsite are all uphill. Follow the trail through the campsite until you reach the junction, then go left to the upper parking lot, up the large set of wooden stairs, before making the final ascent to where you began."
Thunderbird Ridge,4.2,The North Shore,Easy,2.5,6.0,July - September,False,True,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/thunderbird-ridge/,"Thunderbird Ridge is a relatively quick hike from the top of Grouse Mountain that offers scenic views of Crown Mountain, Kennedy Lake, and the city of Vancouver on a clear day. The trail is accessed along the Alpine Trail behind Grouse Mountain, the same route that goes towards Goat Mountain. This trail can be done as a short side trip for any of the other hikes in the area, including Dam Mountain, Goat Mountain, Crown Mountain, Little Goat Mountain, or the Hanes Valley. From the area around the Grouse Mountain chalet, walk towards the bottom of the Peak ski run, passing the Grizzly Bear enclosure on your left. Just to the left of the ski run, follow an old gravel road that wraps around the mountain and gives the occasional glimpse of Georgia Strait. Where the road ends, follow the wide trail up the loose gravel as the route quickly narrows into a hiking path. Watch for a sign, which is a junction point to either take the Alpine or Ridge trails. Go right and follow the route to the Alpine Trail, passing under a pipe and continuing uphill until you reach a zipline platform. Go left at the zipline and follow the trail as you begin to leave the busy crowds at Grouse Mountain behind. Not far along the trail, you reach a sign marking the way to Thunderbird Ridge. Go right at this junction and follow this route as it descends, passing through the low vegetation along the ridge. The trail continues, with the occasional view of Kennedy Lake to your left, before climbing up onto a rocky outcrop. This viewpoint is Thunderbird Ridge and is a great place to stop for lunch or a rest and enjoy the views on a clear, sunny day. After taking in the view, retrace your footsteps back towards the junction at the Alpine Trail and go left, passing the zipline, descending down the steep hill to the old gravel road, and returning back to the Grouse Mountain area."
Triangle Lake,4.0,Sunshine Coast,Easy,3.0,8.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/triangle-lake/,"Triangle Lake is located near Halfmoon Bay on the Sunshine Coast and is a beautiful forested hike with a loop around the lake. The trail passes over small streams as it weaves through a west coast rainforest, while gradually ascending to the viewpoint at Triangle Lake. There are just two views of Triangle Lake and both are somewhat obstructed by trees. Accessing the lake is not easy either as the trail does not get close to it and, at both views, is quite high above it. What makes this hike enjoyable is the scenic forest the trail passes through. From the gravel parking area next to the map board, follow the trail and veer to the right as it enters the forest. This trail ensures that you are on the hiker-only trail. Within minutes, the trail passes over the scenic Colvin Creek where water rushes underneath. Note: There is a waterfall off to the right that can be seen just after the crossing the creek. There is no official trail to the waterfall viewpoint, so be careful and do not venture too close. Continue follow the trail as it meanders through the forest, following Colvin Creek briefly before going right at a junction. The trail gains elevation throughout but has a few moments where there are some slightly steeper hills. The rainforest is lush with ferns, cedar, and Douglas Fir trees. The trail reaches another junction at a sign where there is a short walk to the left to a viewpoint. The trees have grown over the years and not much of a view remains, so it might be worth skipping this viewpoint and going right to continue to Triangle Lake. Not far after the viewpoint junction, go right at another junction that is not marked. Continue on the well defined trail until you reach the final junction marking the 2.8km mark. Again, go right and walk the final uphill section to the viewpoint at Triangle Lake. The view is slightly obstructed but you can look out, across the marshy lake as you sit on the wooden bench. If you plan on hiking the loop around the lake, it takes approximately 40-minutes and is also a very scenic forested trail with one slight view of the lake. The start and end of the loop trail is at the viewpoint near the wooden bench. Follow the loop trail in a counter-clockwise direction, as you quickly leave the area. The trail descends downhill into a valley where it crosses a creek before ascending a steep section. The route wraps around a hill and slowly descends to where a bench sits and looks at a view of Triangle Lake between the trees. Continue following the loop trail until it arrives at a junction where a trail leads out towards the highway to Trout lake. Make sure to go left and continue to loop around Triangle Lake. At another junction a short moment further, go left again. This section of trail along the west side of Triangle Lake veers away, not offering any views of the lake, however the moss-filled forest is breathtaking in itself. After about 40-minutes, you return to the junction at the first viewpoint and bench overlooking Triangle Lake. Take one last look at the lake, then head back down the trail in the direction you arrived earlier, as you begin your hike back. Follow the trail and make sure to check the signs at the junctions and go left. Pass the junction to the viewpoint and, eventually, the final junction as you walk the scenic section back, crossing Colvin Creek and returning to the trailhead."
Tunnel Bluffs,4.1,Howe Sound,Intermediate,4.0,11.5,May - November,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/tunnel-bluffs/,"The hike to Tunnel Bluffs climbs steeply from Lions Bay before briefly following the Mount Brunswick Trail and branching off and following an old logging road to the viewpoint. On a sunny day, the incredible view looks out towards Bowen Island and the Sunshine Coast as well as south to Horseshoe Bay and along the Sea To Sky Highway. From the parking lot at the Sunset Trailhead in Lions Bay, begin your hike following the service road as it climbs steeply at the first switchback. The first section of this hike on the road is the steepest and it continues until you reach the Brunswick Mountain junction after 6 switchbacks (at the 7th switchback). Continue uphill and pass the water reservoir on your right. When you reach what looks like a junction, go right and follow the rocky road as it climbs quickly. At the 7th switchback, and after hiking for about 30-40 minutes up the road, watch for signs on a tree on the left next to a trail that leaves the road. Go left and leave the road, following the Mount Brunswick Trail (continuing uphill will take you to theLions Binkert Trail). Most of the uphill has been completed and the trail is either flat or has minimal elevation gain as you begin to cover distance and make time quickly. Carefully cross the wooden log bridge across Magnesia Creek and continue until you reach a junction with two blue signs. Go left to Tunnel Bluffs (the trail to the right goes up to Mount Brunswick). The trail continues through a long flat stretch, eventually crossing a small creek, followed by another flat stretch, and then crossing another creek with a log bridge. Not far after the bridge, you reach a junction with the old Tunnel Bluffs route that begins at  Tunnel Point along the Sea To Sky Highway. Continue straight and go left at the Hat Mountain junction and continue along the flat trail to Tunnel Bluffs. As you get close, the trail climbs up over some rocky sections as it wraps around, before making the final descent to the viewpoint. On a clear day, the views are outstanding looking out to Bowen Island, Keats Island, and the Sunshine Coast. Pleasure craft cross Howe Sound and the ferries can be seen arriving and leaving Horseshoe Bay in the distance. After enjoying the view, walk back along the trail, following the same route you took earlier. Make sure to go straight at the junction to Lions Bay as you make your way through the forest and eventually return to the service road. Follow the steep service road back down to the Sunset Trailhead parking lot."
Twin Falls,4.0,The North Shore,Easy,1.0,1.5,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/twin-falls/,"Twin Falls is a short, popular hike in North Vancouver that crosses the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and follows Lynn Creek down river before crossing a wooden bridge and looping back on the opposite side of the canyon. While the route is rated as easy compared to many hikes, there is still a significant change in elevation and it is recommended to bring water and be in decent physical shape. From the parking area near the Lynn Canyon Ecology Centre, cross the free suspension bridge and admire Lynn Creek far below. The bridge sits about 50-meters above the creek and was built in 1912 to connect trails on both sides of the canyon. After crossing the suspension bridge, go right at the junction and then right at a second junction to Twin Falls. The route follows the Baden Powell Trail as it makes its way through a scenic forest, lush with lichen, moss, and other sensitive ecology that are common in west coast rainforest areas. The trail begins to descend quickly through a series of stairs and switchbacks. Make your way to the bottom and follow the route as it continues. A final set of wooden steps ends on a rock with a wooden bridge ahead where you can see Twin Falls from above. Walk onto the bridge and enjoy the view of the falls below. There is another view of the waterfall down stream that you can reach by following the trail near the fence as it heads down a steep hill with lots of tree roots. Please do not cross the fence. Stay on the trail side of the fence as the cliffs are steep and the area has several pools that contain dangerous undercurrents. Unfortunately, there have been many people killed over the years in the canyon and we therefore do not recommend swimming in the canyon. After you have enjoyed the area, make your way back to the wooden bridge above Twin Falls and cross to the other side. Start your hike up the steep set of stairs that pass through multiple switchbacks, taking time to catch your breath and enjoy the scenic views. Once at the top, go right and follow the trail as it continues back up hill. The trail veers left and makes a final ascent back up to the parking lot area. Depending on where you parked, you may have to walk up the parking lot further towards the Ecology Centre to the parking lot near the entrance of the park."
Two Canyon Loop,3.3,The North Shore,Easy,3.0,8.0,February - November,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/two-canyon-loop/,"There are many hiking trails on the North Shore but Two Canyon Loop is one of the few scenic trails that takes you through both Lynn Canyon and the Seymour River Canyon passing waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and scenic views along the way. From the parking lot, walk east towards the edge and look for the start of a trail. The trail follows alongside a road and then crosses into a widened path that heads into the forest. Almost immediately is a sign with a trail on the left. Go left onto the Homestead Trail and follow the narrow gravel path as it begins its descent into the canyon towards the Seymour River. After about 10 minutes, the trail levels and arrives at another junction with the Seymour River in view ahead. Go right and walk along the path that follows the river towards the Twin Bridges. After walking along the river for about 10 minutes, you arrive at a tunnel cut into the side of the mountain. This tunnel would be very easy to miss if it were not for the sign on the left side of the trail. This area was heavily logged and many remnants from those days still remain including the tunnel that was used as part of the logging operations. A short distance further down the river you reach Twin Bridges where only one bridge remains standing next to the pillars of what used to be the other bridge. Cross the river and continue along the trail. This section of the park is popular with mountain bikers and offers some of the most challenging and famous terrain in North America, so be wary of sharing the wide trail with the passing cyclists. Stay on the wide trail for quite some distance, passing several trail junctions on your left until you reach a junction with the Baden Powell Trail. At this point, go right and walk down the trail to where a few houses come into view. Before the road, go right staying on the gravel trail as it descends steeply towards the pipe bridge that crosses the canyon below. Take in the view of the Seymour River below before embarking up the steep stairs on the other side of the bridge and following the switchbacks uphill, out of the Seymour River Canyon. As the trail levels, it passes under some power lines and arrives at another junction. Go straight continuing along the Baden Powell Trail to a road. Cross the road where the Baden Powell Trail continues through the forest towards Lynn Creek. At the next junction, again follow the Baden Powell Trail to the right as the trail descends downhill alongside the steep slope before making a final descent down some steps onto raised wooden platforms. Up ahead is an area alongside Lynn Creek that offers a nice view of the second canyon. Back on the wooden boardwalk, continue walking upstream as the trail follows the creek towards Twin Falls. Not far up ahead, a bridge comes into view that crosses over the canyon and offers a view of the waterfalls below. This is popular with tourists as it is only a short walk from the more popular suspension bridge further upstream. After enjoying the view of Twin Falls, walk back to the side of the river that you came from and continue up the trail as it ascends a series of steps and wanders amongst the forests, before eventually reaching a junction. Go left to the Seymour Suspension Bridge and cross the bridge to the Ecology Centre located on the other side. The centre offers a perfect opportunity for a break and a snack from the cafe. From the Ecology Centre, it is only a 10-minute walk back to where you began your hike. Cross back over the suspension bridge and return to the junction, this time going left and heading up the gradual hill. After levelling, the trail emerges at a clearing where a ranger station building lies just off to the right. On the other side of this building is the parking lot where you began earlier in the day."
Tynehead Regional Park,4.0,Surrey and Langley,Easy,1.5,4.5,year-round,True,False,True,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/tynehead-regional-park/,"Tynehead Regional Park is located just of Highway #1 in Surrey and is a popular park for cycling, picnics, dog walking, or exploring the upper Serpentine River. The area features two sides to the park, the east side called the Serpentine Hills has a perimeter bike trail and the west side has hiking trails and the Serpentine Hatchery. We will focus on the west side of the park. There are many trails in Tynehead Park so planning your own route is recommended. We will start our walk from the parking lot at the Tynehead Hatchery and head along the Birch Grove Trail. If you have a dog, go right at the first junction onto the Hawthorn Trail and continue northbound as you enter the dog off-leash area. After letting your dog run free, you can return to the trail by going left at the 4-way junction and heading west to rejoin the Serpentine Loop Trail. For those without a dog, continue past the junction on the Birch Grove Trail and go right at the junction with the Hatchery Trail. The trail descends to another junction where you will continue walking straight and up a short hill that veers to the right. This trail is called the Serpentine Loop. At the next junction, go straight (those coming from the dog off-leash area, go right) and continue along the Serpentine Loop Trail as is meanders through the forest, crossing several streams. At the next junction, walk a few meters to your right and take the trail on your left called the Sunny Trail. After walking up a few wooden steps, the picnic area is located to your left, offering a great location to stop for a snack before heading back. Continuing your walk through Tynehead Park, cross the wooden bridge at the bottom of the picnic area and go right at the junction up a steep hill to the Trillium Viewpoint that overlooks the area. After enjoying the view, walk back down the hill and straight across along the Nurse Stump Trail as you make your way towards the junction with the Serpentine Loop. Go straight and continue along the gravel trail and going left at yet another junction. The trail then descends down a hill to a bridge on the left and another trail called the Salmon Habitat Loop Trail. Go right and take the short loop as there is a nice wooden viewing platform overlooking the Serpentine River. Complete the loop and return to where the wooden bridge crosses the Serpentine River, crossing the bridge, and going right on the other side. Continue following the Hatchery Trail as it takes you back to the Tynehead Hatchery parking lot where you started."
UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest,3.8,Ridge Meadows,Intermediate,3.0,8.0,February - November,False,True,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ubc-malcolm-knapp-research-forest/,"Maintained by the Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia, the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest was established in 1949 from a Crown grant. The forest is located near Maple Ridge and a section of the park contains well marked trails used by hikers and joggers. There are a variety of trails to hike in the area and it is best to pick up a map at the office building by the gate to the park. The map shows several trails by colour and it corresponds with the maps and trail markings throughout the park. For the following description, we have chosen a route that follows the blue trails, eventually looping around the area and ending on the red trails. After passing through the gate, immediately go left and follow a small trail across the grass and into the woods. The forest becomes quite lush with lots of moss as it weaves it way through the forest and across a small stream. Pass the trail junctions and follow the blue trail markings as you begin to descend downhill towards a clearing. At the clearing, peer over the rocks and through the trees at the view of the farmlands in Pitt Meadows. Continue following the blue trail markers to the right as the route gradually descends until reaching another stream crossing. The next section of the hike passes through a variety of mini forests used by UBC for research, evidence of which can often be seen by different colours of ribbons that mark the trees. Walk through each section, crossing the winding gravel road each time and continuing along following the blue trail markers. Once you reach a crossroad with a large signboard on the other side, this will be the final crossroad in this section. The trail continues to the left of the sign and now begins to gradually climb. The site of the next clearing used to have a wooden bridge, however this bridge was destroyed and never rebuilt. The trail continues uphill as it now enters a section of forest that is less maintained from the trails you have been walking up until this point. Go right at the trail junction and continue until you reach a gravel road. There is no trail directly across the road but instead you must walk about 100 meters down the road and watch for blue markings on the left to where the trail enters the forest again. The trail again crosses a small stream and winds through a forest area, crossing two more forestry roads before eventually reaching a wider road with a pond on the left. This marks the end of the blue trail and now the route will follow the yellow and red trails to return to the starting point. Cross the culvert where the pond drains through and immediately go right onto the narrow trail following the yellow markers. Stay on the yellow trail and go right at the junctions until it merges with the red and green trails. Follow the red trail to the left and around a clearing to a gravel road and walk around towards where the trail opens up and arrives back at the gate where you began."
Vedder Ridge Trail,3.8,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,3.5,9.0,May - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/vedder-ridge-trail/,"The Vedder Ridge Trail travels along the west side of Cultus Lake to the top of Vedder Mountain, offering views to the east on a clear day. The majority of the route is forested and has gradual uphill and downhill sections until a short, steep section at the end of the trail, making this route on the easier side of ""intermediate"". From the trailhead with the small wooden signs and the larger Vedder Ridge wooden sign, hike over the dirt mounds and follow the wide trail into the bush. The trail follows an old logging road briefly before veering right to where an old sign-in box and a notice about the trail cling to a tree. Now in the forest, follow the trail up a steep hill, continue along the route with the orange markers on the trees. The entire route is very well marked with these orange markers, so make sure to look up and watch for them to ensure you stay on the trail. After a short steep section, the trail climbs at a much more gradual pace as it passes between two areas that have recently been logged. Continue to follow the trail as it veers to the left, following the ridge through the narrow forest band. Since the trail gradually climbs and occasional descends along the entire route, the total elevation gain for the trip will be much more. After the trail climbs up a short hill with a switchback, continue for another 5 minutes or so and watch for a short trail on your right that heads off to a viewpoint about 15-metres from the trail. The viewpoint overlooks the Fraser Valley, across to Sumas Mountain and the farms in between. Return to the trail as it descends and then passes by a muddy pond. Depending on the time of year, the pond might be dry during the later summer months. Walk up the wooden stairs at the far end and follow the trail as it passes over a rocky outcrop that once offered a viewpoint before the trees grew and blocked it. The trail continues through much of the same forested scenery until it begins to descend, before reaching a small lake. There is not much of a view of the lake, so continue across the wooden boardwalks and follow the trail as it wraps around the other side. After climbing a short hill, the trail arrives at a junction. Go left to follow the route to the top of Vedder Mountain (the trail to the right is known as the West Trail). After going left at the junction, the trail continues to climb, before veering left and climbing steeply over a wooden bridge and then up a steep slope with a rope assist. A bit further up and the trail has a second rope assist as it passes over some wooden steps. After the second rope, the first viewpoint from Vedder Mountain can be seen to the left. Continue a bit further up to where there is a larger clearing on the left and a place to sit on the rocks with a stunning view looking to the east. The peak of Vedder Mountain is a short distance further up the trail but it is surrounded by trees and there is no view. Once you have enjoyed the view, hike back down the trail, being careful through the sections with the ropes and returning to the trail and the junction. Make sure to go right at the junction, back along the Vedder Ridge Trail. Follow the trail as it passes the lake, the muddy pond by the wooden stairs, and the viewpoint. Eventually, the trail descends steeply to the wide path and only a short distance from here returns you to the trailhead."
Vedder River Rotary Trail,4.0,Fraser Valley East,Easy,6.0,20.8,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/vedder-river-rotary-trail/,"The Vedder River Rotary Trail is a beautiful trail that follows the Vedder River for about 8km offering many scenic views. The trail is a popular walking, jogging, or cycling route and busy on the weekends with families and others out walking their dogs. There are several parking lots located throughout the route and you can choose to do a shorter version of the trail. The route described below begins at Vedder Park and goes the entire route, ending at the North Dyke Trail. From Vedder Park, walk past the playground towards the river and begin following the Vedder River Rotary Trail, walking alongside the river in the downstream direction. For the first 3.5km, the trail follows the river, offering scenic views of the surrounding landscape and wildlife, such as ducks, geese, eagles, and the occasional heron. On a nice day, there are often quite a few people fishing along the river. After about 3.5km, the trail veers away from the river and reaches the junction with the Peach Creek Rotary Trail. Continue to follow the Vedder River Rotary Trail as it veers back towards the river. Further down river, cross the bridge over Peach Creek and continue to where the Hopedale parking lot area is. There are plenty of benches along the trail to stop and soak in the scenic views of the area. The trail passes underneath a train bridge as it continues to make its way downstream. Eventually, you cross a small wooden bridge and reach the junction to the Great Blue Heron Nature Reserve. The nature reserve has several trails and a viewing platform for bird watching throughout the area. There is also a building with educational displays and a gift shop. Continue following the Rotary Trail as it crosses another wooden bridge, before passing through a forested area with the occasional view of the river. When it reaches a junction, go right and continue to the end of the trail to the metal gate marking the end of the trail. To return, you can simply walk back the same way that you came or you can follow the North Dyke Trail at the metal gate. The North Dyke Trail returns to the Great Blue Heron Nature Reserve and, if you didn't already stop, this is a great opportunity to do so. From the Nature Reserve, you can continue to follow the North Dyke Trail or return to the Rotary Trail via one of the nature reserve trails. Continue to make your way east back up the Vedder River until you reach Vedder Park where you began."
Velodrome Trail,3.6,Vancouver City,Intermediate,1.0,3.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/velodrome-trail/,"Sometimes called Burnaby's Grind, the Velodrome Trail climbs steeply from the Barnet on the north side of Burnaby Mountain and arrives at the Japanese totem poles at Horizons Restaurant. Hikers walk up more than 500 wooden steps before the trail joins with the Pandora Trail for the rest of the route to the top. The trailhead is located at the northeast corner of the Velodrome. To get to the trailhead, walk from the gravel parking lot to the traffic lights, then cross the street and walk up the driveway. At the first opportunity, go left and walk in front of the Velodrome to the far end where a gravel trail heads into the forest, marking the start of your climb. The initial trail climbs gradually over the rocky terrain and before long, you reach a junction with the the Mountain Air Trail. Go right and continue uphill as the first set of wooden stairs begins. There is a brief section of dirt trail before things get steep with lots of wooden stairs. Continue walking up the stairs, stopping to occasionally look back at glimpses Burrard Inlet between the trees. After hiking up more than 500 stairs, the trail levels and reaches a junction with the Pandora Trail. Go left and pass another junction a few meters beyond and follow the trail at a more gradual rate. Not much further and the trail opens up into a clearing as you walk up a steep gravel section. The trail veers right at a rock and, just past a large tree, the Japanese totem poles come into view. Keep going as the trail weaves back and then one last uphill brings you to the top behind Horizons Restaurant where there are several viewpoints looking out at Indian Arm and Burrard Inlet. After you've enjoyed the views, you can retrace your steps back downhill, making sure to turn right onto the Velodrome Trail and descend down the wooden stairs back to the Barnet."
Watersprite Lake,4.1,Howe Sound,Intermediate,7.0,17.0,July - September,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/watersprite-lake/,"The hiking trail to the turquoise coloured Watersprite Lake offers some incredible views of the area around the Mamquam River, including mountain peaks in the southern region of Garibaldi Provincial Park, Martin Peak, Dreadnought Peak, and extensive views of the Watersprite Creek Valley. The scenic trail begins east of Squamish, about 20km up the Mamquam and Skookum Forestry Service Roads and follows old logging roads overlooking the valley before a final ascent up a boulder field to the lake. The following describes the trail to Watersprite Lake that was built by the British Columbia Mountaineering Club and completed in September 2016. The old route has been deactivated due to extensive wear and damage to the bog portion of the trail. This route follows deactivated logging road routes along higher ridges, offering many scenic scenic views on the way to the lake. From the parking lot area, pass the metal gate and follow the old gravel road that veers off to the right, heading up a gradual hill. A Trail Kiosk with maps and information is schedule to be installed at the top of this Hill in 2017. The trail continues through an open gravel section, passing the Skookum Dam below to your left, before narrowing and joining an old logging road. This section of trail climbs gently and passes over a couple of creeks, including the bridge over Skullhead Creek, as you quickly make time along the route. After walking for about 20 - 30 minutes (1.5 km), the trail veers left and onto a section of narrow trail that first descends quickly, before climbing through the forest.  Follow the orange aluminum tree markers until you reach a junction at a wide trail which is an old logging road.  Note this junction as you will return to here and will need to follow the narrow trail back to the parking lot. Go right on the wide trail and continue hiking along the well defined route as you cross another wooden bridge over Skullhead Creek, this time further. The trail veers sharply left after about 1.4km and climbs up a steep, rocky section for about 600-meters before veering right and opening up to a view of the valley below. As you continue along the trail, just beyond the clearing with the viewpoint, the trail crosses a small creek next to a waterfall. After emerging from the creek bed, follow the trail for another 600-meters until it rounds a corner and arrives on a ridge, known as ""The Prow Lookout"", that overlooks the entire valley.  From here, you can witness one of the most scenic viewpoints in the region, seeing as far down the Mamquam River Valley towards Squamish, across the valley to Columnar Peak and the Garibaldi Provincial Park area, and up towards Spire Peaks, Pyramid Peak, and many more. Continue following the trail along the route to Watersprite Lake for the next 2.3km as it offers many open views of the surrounding mountains and the Watersprite Creek Valley below. The trail continues climbing gradually until it reaches a rockslide area. As the rockslide slows your pace, follow the markings and flags across the rockslide for about 800-meters until you enter the forest on the far end. The trail passes through a forested section, crossing Watersprite Creek before exiting the forest and crossing a second boulder field. The very steep ascent up the boulder field is the final section of trail to the lake. Carefully make your way up the rocks, following the trail until it begins to level and Watersprite Lake comes into view. Walk out onto the rocky outcrop for a full view of the scenic area, including the turquoise coloured lake, Martin Peak, and Dreadnought Peak. There are several locations around the lake to enjoy lunch and the scenery but please ensure to find a location that has minimal impact on the sensitive ecology. A cabin and were built by the BCMC in 2016 and are located on the west side of the lake. After enjoying time at the lake, begin your hike back by follow the trail back down the rockslide and heading to the right side of the slide to where the trail continues. Cross Watersprite Creek and follow the route through the forest, back across the rockslide and along the open trail with many views. Descend down the rocky section before veering right and following the trail back to the 3-way junction. Make sure to go left at the 3-way junction, following the trail downhill and returning via the first section to the parking lot near Skookum Dam."
Wedgemount Lake,4.7,Whistler,Difficult,7.0,12.0,July - September,False,True,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/wedgemount-lake/,"The hike to Wedgemount Lake is one of the most difficult in Garibaldi Provincial Park, with an elevation gain of more than 1100 meters in just 7km. However, the spectacular alpine scenery makes the grueling trek well worth it. Before leaving, make sure you've packed plenty of water as well as a jacket. Temperatures can surprisingly be very cool at the top even on the warmest days in mid-summer. The trail begins with minimal incline as it weaves its way through second-generation growth forest. After walking for about 20 minutes, you come to two bridges that cross Wedge Creek. Cross the bridges and continue along the trail for a few minutes where you will catch a glimpse of a large rockslide area to the left. From here, the trail begins to climb through a series of switchbacks. Another 40 minutes or so up the trail, you cross a rockslide that offers a view of the valley below. Continue your uphill climb. When the trail begins to level and the wind blows through the trees, you will come to another opening with a large rockslide area. This is approximately the halfway point and perhaps the perfect opportunity for a break. Climb over the loose rocks as the trail continues along the lower section of the slide. Continue heading uphill along the trail as it becomes steeper. Another 40 minutes uphill and you will catch the first glimpse of Wedgemount Waterfall, a spectacular sight where the water drops over 300 meters. There are only a few points where the falls are visible from the trail and are easy to miss as your head is down watching where your are stepping. Another 20 minutes beyond the last viewpoint and you reach the tree line where you can see another beautiful view of the valley and the steep, rocky slope that lies ahead. Continue along the trail as it makes its way up the rocks, sometimes passing through streams from the winter runoff. The last section of the trail is the steepest as you scramble your way over the rocks up to the top. There are no trail markers but the path is worn from use by other hikers, so follow these marks as you use your hands to carefully climb through this steep section. The trail reappears again and begins to level out as a glacier becomes visible. A few more minutes and the BCMC (British Columbia Mountaineering Club) hut becomes visible as well as the stunning turquoise-coloured Wedgemount Lake. The area by the BCMC hut offers a perfect place to stop for lunch and to soak in the views of the entire Wedgemount Lake area. After lunch, follow the trail marked with stones to the furthest end of the lake for a full view of the glacier. After enjoying the scenery, head back towards the hut and along the trail to begin your descent back towards the parking lot. Make sure to leave plenty of time to return as the descent can be difficult through the steep section and the wet tree roots in the forest can be very slippery and dangerous. Keeping these in mind, the hike back downhill takes just as long as hiking up to the lake."
Whippoorwill Point Trail,4.1,Fraser Valley East,Easy,1.5,4.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/whippoorwill-point-trail/,"Harrison Hot Springs is a popular tourist spot during the summer but few people venture beyond the crowded beaches, restaurants, and spa. However, the Whippoorwill Point Trail offers a nice escape from the crowds and is a short 4km hiking trail that passes the hidden Sandy Cove beach and offers several views of the Harrison River. This trail is fairly steep in sections and it's recommended for those with proper footwear and in good physical condition. From the metal gate outside the Harrison Hot Springs Resort, follow the wide gravel service road around the end of the lake. Many people walk out this route to see ""The Source"" of the hot springs but turn back after. Pass ""The Source"" and several meters further, you reach the end of the road at a metal fence. Look to your left and follow a very steep trail that enters the forest and goes up the side of the mountain. There are not many trail markers at the beginning of the route, so just watch for the worn path, which is fairly easy to follow. The trail reaches a wide area and it looks as though it goes around the rock, however that leads to a dead-end. Instead of going around the rock, go left just before it and up the steep section, over tree roots, and the trail will veer to the right and pass over that same rock. Follow the rough trail as it drops down and then back up a few steps before leveling out. The trail starts to change from rugged into a well, worn dirt path that's fairly flat, passing moss covered rocks and getting away from the noise of the crowded beach area. After only a few minutes, the trail descends and veers to the right where you reach a ""T"" junction, with the option of either going right or left. This point marks the beginning and end of the loop that the Whippoorwill Point Trail does. Go right and continue down a slight hill, as you step over a rock, pass some fallen trees, and reach a beach known as Sandy Cove. This is normally not a busy beach as the only ways to access it are to hike the trail you just did or to get there by boat. It also offers a scenic view of Harrison Lake, the surrounding mountains, and is a nice place for lunch. The trail continues at the far end of the beach and is easy to miss. However, if you walk along the edge of the beach and forest area and look up, there is a white cross on one of the trees and a visible path at the base of that tree. Follow the path as it weaves through the forest and reaches an old wooden triangle marker used for boats to indicate the point next to the Harrison River. The trees have grown over the years and therefore, don't offer much of a view of the lake or river through this part. Continue following the trail and watching for trail markers on trees as this section of trail is fairly well marked. The trail briefly climbs a small hill before descending and following alongside the Harrison River. There is a short trail that goes to a rocky bluff with a view of the Harrison River. This trail isn't easy to find as there is no marker for it, however it's at a fairly low point of the hiking trail, just before the trail steps up onto some rocks. Also, the path is a bit worn, so keep an open for it on your right and it should be noticeable. The short path takes you up onto a rock where there are metal remnants of industry left over from the years past. After enjoying the viewpoint, return to the trail and continue as it follows the river and offers a few more views down stream. Watch for the trail markers as the trail then goes left and uphill, back into the forest. A short hike through an overgrown set of bushes and you arrive back at the ""T"" junction. Go right, up the hill and head back the way you came, passing the large rock and carefully descending down the steep slope back onto the gravel road. A short walk along the road brings you back to Harrison."
Whistler Train Wreck,3.9,Whistler,Easy,1.0,2.0,May - November,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/whistler-train-wreck/,"A part of Whistler's historical and cultural identity, the Train Wreck site is a popular attraction and is located near the Cheakamus River just south of Whistler. The short hiking trail follows the Sea To Sky Trail and crosses a suspension bridge, offering scenic views of the Cheakakmus River rushing below before arriving at the colourfully painted box cars, which have sat in the forest since 1956. To get to the Whistler Train Wreck, follow the trail at the side of Jane Lakes Road past the Sea To Sky Trail sign and into the forest. The majority of the trail to the Whistler Train Wreck site is easy, with a very short steep downhill near the suspension bridge but easy enough for all ages. The trail meanders along the gravel path through the lush forest. At a junction, go right following the signs to the Train Wreck and passing the skis on the tree. This section of trail has a lot of tree roots along the path, so be careful to watch your step. As the trail begins to slowly descend, the Cheakamus River comes into view between the trees. Continue down a short steep section before the trail veers right to the suspension bridge crossing the Cheakamus River. Enjoy the view of the rushing water in the canyon below as you cross the bridge. The suspension bridge was built in the summer of 2016 in response to people hiking to the train wreck along active train tracks by illegally trespassing on the railroad's property. The suspension bridge connects trails on the east and west side of the Cheakamus River. After crossing the suspension bridge, walk the short distance up the hill and you're in the middle of the train wreck site, with box cars on both sides of you. Take your time walking around and checking out the wreck and the ramps that have been built for mountain bikers. There are 2 additional box cars that many hikers miss that are a few minutes further south (downstream direction) from the group of box cars. The entire Train Wreck site consists of 7 box cars, all of which have been painted over the years and have become a popular tourist attraction. After enjoying the area, cross back over the suspension bridge and go right, following the trail up the steep section and back to the junction. Go left at the junction and walk the short distance back to the road where you parked."
Whyte Lake,4.0,The North Shore,Easy,2.0,5.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/whyte-lake/,"Whyte Lake is a small, peaceful lake in the hills of West Vancouver above Horseshoe Bay. The trail is scenic, following Nelson Creek uphill through a grove of Western Cedar and Douglas Fir trees and pass several large old growth giants. The trail begins at a somewhat steep pace but, overall, is relatively short and easy. From the metal gate in the gravel parking area just off of Westport Road, walk down the gravel access road as it weaves and passes under the highway. Just after the overpass, follow the gravel access road up a steep slope. While the trail is rated easy, this will be the steepest section of your climb and is not very long, so take your time. Just after the road veers left and a water tower comes into view, look for a trail sign post to the right. Take this trail to the right and walk into the forest, continuing uphill. This section of the trail is part of the Trans Canada Trail. It continues to climb at a more gradual rate as you enjoy the second growth forest. Within 15 - 20 minutes, you will reach a trail sign at a junction. Go left onto the Whyte Lake trail and walk down the short hill to where the trail passes along some wooden railings. Through this section, be sure to look up at the trees as there are several large, old-growth Douglas Firs along the canyon. The trail continues through the forest, eventually passing over a wooden bridge over Nelson Creek. In the spring, it will often be muddy and may occasionally have snow covering it during the winter months. Not long after passing over a second wooden bridge, the trail reaches a sign pointing to Whyte Lake to the right. Go right and within a minute, you arrive at the small wooden dock and the quiet lake. After enjoying your time at the lake, retrace your steps back down the hill, going right at the junction onto the Trans Canada Trail, then following the gravel road back down, under the highway and back to the metal gate where you began. Hike Extension to the Baden Powell For those looking for a longer hike, you can continue along the Whyte Lake Trail past the lake, over the wooden boardwalks, to a junction. Go left at this jucntion and downhill a short distance where the trail will join the Baden Powell Trail. At the Baden Powell Trail, if you go right and follow the trail uphill, it will take you toEagle Bluffsbut it's a long, difficult hike. There are sections of the Baden Powell that are quite steep and challenging ."
Whyte Lake via Horseshoe Bay,3.0,The North Shore,Easy,1.25,4.0,March - November,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/whyte-lake-horseshoe-bay/,"Whyte Lake is a small scenic lake, nestled in the forest above the Trans-Canada Highway in West Vancouver. Themost common route to Whyte Lakebegins just off of Westport Road, however this route follows the western-most section of the Baden Powell Trail, starting near Horseshoe Bay, before branching off to the lake. The trailhead of the Baden Powell (and this route to Whyte Lake) begins from a small gravel parking lot at the side of Highway Exit #2's off ramp, on the other side of the fence from the ferry terminal ticket booths. Follow the trail, past the fence, as it climbs steadily. After the initial uphill section, the trail follows alongside concrete slabs from the Sea To Sky Highway before making its way under a bridge next to a creek. Go left after passing under the bridge and continue follow the path in the direction of the highway. The route reaches another steep uphill section and, as you climb up the wide path, you begin to leave the sounds of the highway behind you. Continue uphill, occasionally catching your breath, until the trail begins to level and continues through a wide forested section. The break is brief as the trail again gains elevation quickly. Eventually, the Baden Powell Trail that you are following reaches a sign at a junction. Go right to Whyte Lake and follow the trail uphill. Once the trail reaches another junction, go right and walk across the wooden boardwalks. A short distance after the boardwalks, go left at the sign and walk to the dock on Whyte Lake. After enjoying the views of the lake from the dock, return to the trail and go right, walking across the long boardwalks. After the boardwalks, go left and down the hill until you reach the junction with the Baden Powell Trail. Follow the Baden Powell Trail back downhill towards Horseshoe Bay where you began your hike."
Whytecliff Park,3.0,The North Shore,Easy,1.5,2.0,year-round,True,False,True,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/whytecliff-park/,"Situated in the rugged coastline along the shores of Howe Sound in West Vancouver, the scenic mountains and passing boats offer spectacular views for visitors to Whytecliff Park to enjoy. Not only does Whytecliff Park have a series of hiking trails but you can also explore the beach and island area, have a family picnic in the park, or even scuba dive in what's known as a famous area for underwater diving. The park is divided into two sections, with the upper section having the majority of hiking trails and being much quieter than the beach area. There are some short trails from the beach and along the shoreline edge near the main parking lot but if you want to explore the hiking trails, you will have to start from the top of the overflow parking lot. At the top of the overflow parking, a small trail climbs steeply into the forest. A short climb up the hill and there is an unmarked set of rock stairs on the right which are easy to miss. The viewpoint at the top of these stairs used to overlook Batchelor Bay but the trees have grown over the years to block this view. Back on the main trail and another short walk uphill, the trail forks at a fire hydrant into what is the first of a few loops. You will want to plan your route so that you take one part of the loop first and then return via the other part of the loop. Go left at the junction and up a short hill to where a bench sits overlooking Howe Sound and the passing ferry and sailboats below. Continue along the trail as it winds around the rock. Stay to the left and walk out onto a rocky clearing as it gradually descends before meeting up with another trail. Go left and continue your hike, staying left at the next two junctions and catching glimpses of the occasional view of Howe Sound. Eventually the trail meets a final junction where a short trail on the right takes you out of the park and into a nearby neighbourhood. Go right at this junction and begin the loop back to the overflow parking lot. This section of trail weaves through a forested area that is quiet compared to the popular beach area of the park that most people are familiar with. Not far along the trail, go left at the junction and continue walking through the forest. The trail briefly backtracks as you ascend quickly up a hill before meeting up with a section of trail you were on earlier. Go left and walk back along the path, staying to the left and, this time, passing through the middle of a big rock. After walking between the rock walls, you reach the junction with the fire hydrant and it's only a short walk back down the hill to the parking lot. Whytecliff Park Beach and Island To further explore the park, walk to the main parking lot area and not far from the entrance, follow a paved walkway at the side down towards the beach. During low tide, you can walk along the rocks to Whytecliff Island and climb to its peak but be sure to return before the tide rises and traps you from reaching the shore. At the west side of the beach, there is a trail that climbs onto the large rock marked only by rock steps. Follow these steps as it ascends over the rock and then into a roughly marked path that weaves it's way high above the shoreline. Along the route, you will find several benches to sit and enjoy the view and even a picnic table. The end of the trail exits back into the parking lot at the opposite end of the park near the observation point."
Widgeon Falls,4.2,Ridge Meadows,Easy,6.0,15.0,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/widgeon-falls/,"Updated November 2024- The canoe rental shop is currently closed and scheduled to open May 20, 2025. ContactXwumfor more details. It isn't often that you can combine a day of hiking with a beautiful canoe trip through marshlands. The route to Widgeon Falls combines both of these as you paddle along Widgeon Slough to the campsite before begining a 3km one-way hike to the scenic waterfall. Start your trek by paddling across Pitt Lake towards the Widgeon Slough. Make your way along the waterway keeping an eye out for ducks, herons, deer, and even bears along the shorelines. After paddling for about 30 minutes, you'll reach a fork in the creek. Stay to your left and continue paddling. Depending on the time of year, you may have to get out of the canoe and pull the canoe through sections as the creek can become quite shallow. Eventually, you will arrive at the campsite. Pitt Lake is the only tidal lake in Western Canada and make sure to pull the canoe up onto shore far enough if it's low tide. The trail portion begins to the right of the campsite. Follow the service road along for 20 minutes, watching for a sign on the right side of the trail that says 'Widgeon Falls'. At this point, you can either continue along the service road which will take you to the falls or take the trail which ends up following along the shores of Widgeon Creek. The trail is a nice change from the basic service road and provides several views of Widgeon Creek. Follow the trail through the forest of Cedar, Fir, and Maple trees. After an hour of hiking, the trail reaches the lower falls which is a perfect spot for wading in the water on a hot, sunny day. Continue hiking along the trail for another 10 minutes to reach the upper falls. The water has flowed over these rocks for hundreds of years, carving smooth paths and sculpting them into their current forms. This is the perfect location to stop for lunch. Keeping in mind the canoe trip back down Widgeon Creek, make sure to leave enough time to return. Perhaps take the quicker route along the service road back to the campsite instead of the trail. Make your way back through Widgeon Slough and across Pitt Lake to the Grant Narrows boat launch area where you started. If you camp at the Widgeon Creek Campsite, you can hike beyond the falls and up towards Widgeon Lake. This hike from the campsite takes approximately 5 hours round trip which does not leave enough time if you are trying to do the entire trip from the parking lot to the lake in one day. The peaceful lake surrounded by granite bluffs is the perfect reward for a hiking and camping trip over a long weekend."
Woodland Walk Trail,3.9,Tri Cities,Easy,3.0,8.0,year-round,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/woodland-walk-trail/,"Located in the mountains above Coquitlam, the Woodland Walk Trail passes through Pinecone Burke Provincial Park to the scenic Sawblade Falls. The trail begins near the top of Harper Road and gently climbs through second generation growth forest before reaching Woodland Falls. A short, steep climb next to the creek brings you to Sawblade Falls further upstream. There are a couple of notable issues to hiking in this area. First, the proximity of all the noise from gunfire that comes from the Port Coquitlam and District Hunting and Fishing Club. The gunshots from the shooting range are loud and can be heard until you get quite far away into the forest of the Burke Mountain area. The second issue is there are a lot of trails and they are not well marked in terms of signage. A lot of time and effort has been made by theBurke Mountain Naturaliststo improve and mark the trails over the years but the task is daunting and with recent development in the area by BC Hydro, routes have been affected and will see some changes to them in the future. The trail for the Woodland Walk begins right at the metal gate along Harper Road. Do not walk up the gravel road, instead walk onto the trail directly to the left of the metal gate and follow this trail as it weaves its way up hill, over wooden steps and planks. Within 10 minutes or so of hiking, the trail reaches a gravel forestry road. Immediately, go left and follow a trail that leads back into the forest and away from the gravel road. Within 10 minutes or so, the trail reaches a clearing underneath a set of BC Hydro power lines. The area has been opened up in recent years as BC Hydro expands the power lines. Go left and follow the gravel road underneath he power lines, continuing across the bridge over Prichard Creek. Within a few minutes after crossing the creek, watch for trail markers on your right that mark the Upper Loop for the Woodland Walk route. Enter the forest and follow this trail as it very gradually ascends through the second generation growth. The trail continues to meander through the forest until it reaches a junction. Continue straight at the junction, staying on the Upper Loop route. At a second junction, go left and take the short connector trail down to the Lower Loop. At the junction on the Lower Loop, go right and you should see a very large stump located on the left side of the trail. Continue past the stump for a short distance until you reach a creek and, walking down the narrow trail towards the water will bring you to Woodland Falls. Located further upstream, Sawblade Falls is much more spectacular than Woodland Falls. To reach Sawblade Falls, walk out of the canyon and back to the main trail, then look for a trail that heads steeply uphill and is parallel to the creek. This trail climbs quickly through several switchbacks before reaching a rocky clearing, then disappearing back into the forest to a junction with several trails. At the junction, veer left and continue staying close to the creek and the trail will narrow and take you right down towards the Sawblade Falls. To return, walk back to the junction and look for a trail that goes downhill to the left of the one you came up. Do not go left and follow the flat, old logging road. Follow the trail downhill as it winds its way through the forest and reaches the junction with the connector trail you took earlier. Go right and down that same connector trail but at the bottom, go left this time and begin your walk back, this time returning along the Lower Loop route. Continue following the Lower Loop and, when you reach a junction, go right as the trail descends gradually. The trail opens up as you arrive back at the power lines. Walk to the left along the gravel road under the power lines, passing the start of the Upper Loop route and walking over the Prichard Creek bridge. Just after the bridge, go right and follow the trail back the same route that you took earlier. When it reaches the gravel road, immediately go right and stay on the forested trail, as it quickly descends bringing you back to Harper Road where you began."
Yeo Point,0.0,Southern Gulf Islands,Easy,4.0,9.6,year-round,True,False,False,True,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/yeo-point/,"The hike to Yeo Point on Salt Spring Island begins in Beaver Point Provincial Park before crossing into Ruckle Provincial Park, passing through a lush west coast rainforest and following a scenic trail along the coastline. There are many views along the coastal section, looking out into the Salish Sea, including the scenic view at Yeo Point at the end of the route. A short trail leads to a rocky beach that is worth exploring near Yeo Point. Starting from the dirt parking lot in Beaver Point Provincial Park, walk to the sign with a park map and begin the trail to the right of the park map. The trail will very gradually climb as it meanders through the forest. There are a couple of junctions early in the trail but both routes lead to the same place, so you can choose either option. The trail continues for sometime through the forest as it gradually descends then ascends again, minimally changing in elevation. The forest is lush with Western Cedar and Douglas Fir trees and the forest floor is covered with ferns and other foliage common throughout the Gulf Islands. The trail eventually reaches a junction with a trail to the right that goes to a hilltop and continues onto the farm area of Ruckle Provinicial Park. Go left at this junction and continue hiking towards Yeo Point. At another junction, the trail to the right goes towards Merganser Pond and also towards the nearby farm. Again, go to the left and continue towards Yeo point as the route descends through the forest towards the coast. When the trail reaches another junction, you have arrived at King's Cove, offering a beautiful view of the beach. This marks the beginning of the coastal section of the hike. Go left at King's Cove and follow the trail along the coastline as it makes its way up, over, and around the rocky outcrops. The views are stunning and distracting as you carefully watch your step on the rocky sections of the trail. There are several Arbutus Trees along the coastal trail, shedding their bark in the elements. Carefully make your way down a steep hill as the trail abruptly drops down into the forest and you reach a sign at a junction. Going right will take you down a short trail to the rocky beach where you can explore the shoreline. Continue straight and walk about 5 minutes further to Yeo Point, climbing up onto the rock at the end where you are treated to a spectacular view. The view across the channel looks towards Prevost Island and North Pender Island. It's likely that you will see a ferry pass by as the Salt Spring Long Harbour Ferry and the Tsawwassen to Victoria Ferry both sail through the nearby channels. After enjoying the views at Yeo Point and exploring the beach area, begin your hike back, following the coastline trail, soaking in the views for the final time. When you reach the junction at King's Cove, go right and follow the interior forested trail as it gradually climbs away from the coast. Continue to the right of the next junctions as you retrace your steps back to the parking lot at Beaver Point Provincial Park where you began."
Zoa Peak,0.0,Fraser Valley East,Intermediate,4.5,8.0,June - October,True,False,False,False,https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/zoa-peak/,"Located in the Coquihalla Summit Recreation Area, the hike to Zoa Peak follows a ridge offering incredible views of Zum Peak, Thar Peak, and Nak Peak. Begin your hike form the parking lot by walking up the gravel road, across the creek, and stay on the road as you pass the sign pointing towards Falls Lake. Continue up the gravel trail until you reach a 2nd sign, then go left to Zoa Peak. The trail climbs steeply under a cover of alder trees before veering right and following another old road uphill. This section climbs quickly and there is very little shade, making for a hot hike in the middle of summer. Eventually, the trail reaches another sign which points left to Zoa Peak. Go left and follow the trail, carefully climbing up the rocks and continuing through a forested section of trail. The trail passes a brief open clearing, where there are a few views to be seen in the distance, before continuing uphill in the trees. Not as steep as in the beginning, the trail begins to level as you pass quickly through open trees within the sub alpine. At, what appears to be a junction, go right and follow the markers. A short distance further, go left at a junction. Keep an eye out for markers on trees and make sure to keep following them. The trail climbs up onto some rocky outcrops and where some of the first views can be seen, including the big mountain far ahead in the distance called Zum Peak. Continue to follow the trail as it makes its way over the rocky section of Zoa's false peak as you continue to enjoy the views. The trail descends suddenly and, at the bottom, there is a spectacular view of Thar Peak to the left. After enjoying the view, begin to ascend a steep section of trail that will be the final ascent to Zoa Peak. As you walk up the steep hill, look back occasionally to take in the views down the valley. The trail begins to level and continues further until it reaches a rock with a sign with a notice that this marks the end of the maintained trail. While there is no main viewpoint at the end, it is worth continuing a few minutes further along the trail and looking for a couple of viewpoints. One viewpoint provides a good view of Zum Peak to the north. You may be able to catch some glimpses between the trees of Thar Peak and Yak Peak to the south. After exploring the area, begin your hike back in the direction that you arrived. Be careful hiking back as there are several worn trails near the end and it's easy to follow one of them, taking your in the wrong direction. Make sure to pass the sign marking the end of the maintained trail, then follow the trail back as it will descend back down into the valley with the view of Thar Peak. The views on the way back are quite spectacular as you make your way through he alpine. The trail descends back down into the trees as you descend quickly. After passing through the forest, you eventually reach the sign with the open trail. Go right and follow it downhill to the 2nd sign. Go right again and return to the parking lot where you began. Since you are in the area, it's also worth the short hike toFalls Lake, which is only about 900m away."
